          <p>
            Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or, other adverbs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-4">
          <p>
            Adjectives are not the only modifiers in the world of grammar. Just as nouns and pronouns sometimes require
            description, so do verbs and adjectives. For this descriptive purpose, language include adverbs. Adverbs modify
            verbs, adjectives, and even other adverbs. As modifiers of verbs, they indicate when, where, how, or how often an action
            is performed.<br><br>
            they'll arrive <strong>soon</strong>. (when) <br>
            Put the flowers <strong>here</strong>. (where) <br>
            She dances <strong> awkwardly</strong> y. (how) <br>
            Cynthia travels <strong>frequently </strong>.(how) <br><br>

            In the first example, the adverb <strong>soon</strong> modifies the verb arrive. It tells when the arrival
            will occur. In the second, the adverb <strong>here</strong> modifies the verb put. It tells where the flowers should
            be placed. In the third, the adverb   <strong>awkwardly</strong> modifies the verb dances. It tells how she dances.
            In the final example, the adverb frequently modifies the verb <strong>travels</strong>. It tells how often Cynthia travels.<br><br>

            As you now know, adverbs do not only modifies only verbs. They also describes adjectives and other adverbs.<br><br>

            Kareem Abdul Jabar is <strong>extremely </strong> tall.<br>
            Anthony sings <strong>quite</strong>  exquisitely.  <br><br>

            In the first example, the adverb extremely modifies the adjective <strong>tall</strong>. It indicates how tall kareem is.
            In the second example, the adverb <strong>quite</strong> modifies the adverb <strong>exquisitely </strong>
            . It indicates how exquisite Anthony's singing is. Incidentlly, the adverb exquisitely modifies the verb sings. It tells
            how Anthony sings.

          <h5 class="">AN ADVERB QUESTION</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong>   An editor of a dictionary was writing its foreword. He called about the sentence "The world is a much different place
            from what it was fifty years ago." The editor asked, "What do you think of the use of <strong>much</strong> in the sentence? I thinkit sounds funny." <br>
            <br><strong> Ans.</strong> I see no problem with the use of the word   <strong>much</strong>. The word <strong>different</strong> is an adjective, describing <strong>place</strong>
            , a noun. The word much, an adverb modifies <strong>different</strong>, an adjective. Each of the parts of speech is in its proper place.

            <br>

            The phrase <strong>much different</strong> may look or sound strange to some readers, although it is grammatically correct. Much is an adverb and has been
            since the thirteenth century when it came to being. Therefore, <strong>much</strong> can describe <strong>different</strong>.
            If your ears still resist, try <strong>very different</strong> or <strong>extremely different</strong>. Both <strong>very </strong>
            and <strong>extremely</strong> are also verbs, capable of modifying an adjective such as <strong>different</strong>.
          </p>

        <hr>

        <div class="mt-4">
          <h5>ANOTHER ADVERB QUESTION</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> "Is <strong>intresting enough</strong> or <strong>interestingly enough</strong> correct? " asked one caller.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ans.</strong> Either one will work, depending on how you use the words. Many people use the phrase <strong>interestingly enough</strong>
            as an introductory expression. In this context, <strong>enough</strong> is an adverb modifies another adverb, <strong>interestingly</strong>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>interestingly enough</strong>, the burglars were never caught.</p>

          <p>We can also use the phrase <strong>intersting enough</strong> in a grammatically correct sentence.</p>

          <p>The book was <strong>interesting enough </strong> to attract the attention of the censor.</p>

          <p>In this context, <strong>interesting</strong> is an adjective modified by the adverb <strong>enoughs</strong></p>
        </div><hr>

        <div class="mt-5">
          <h5>YET ANOTHER ADVERB QUESTION</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> One caller heard a radio personality say, "It look twenty years to evolve this highly." He asked, "Has the announcer used <strong>highly</strong> in the right way? I think he has, but I need some validation."

            <p>
              <strong>Ans.</strong> The radio personality did use <strong>highly</strong>, an adverb, in the correct way. It
              describes the infinitive <strong>to evolve</strong>. Since infinitives are forms of verbs, they can modified by adverbs.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, the sentence falls short of squeakely clean. The adverb <strong>highly</strong> is modified by the demonstrative
              pronoun <strong>this</strong>. Grammar allows us to use pronouns to modify noun or other pronouns. An advreb requires an adverb modifier. Let's change <strong>this</strong> to <strong>so</strong>
              . The announcer could have said, "It took twenty years to evolve so highly."
            </p>

          </p>
        </div><hr>

        <div class="mt-5">
          <h5>CREATING ADVERB</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong>"Do I just add <strong>-ly</strong> to an adjective to change it into an adverb?" asked an inquiring seventh-grader.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Ans.</strong>The adverbs we know the best are those ending in <strong>-ly</strong>, and, most of these are based on adjectives. We add <strong>-ly</strong>
            to these adjective and the result is an adverb (adjective + <strong>-ly</strong> --> adverb).
            Note that for those adjectives ending in y, changes the <strong>y</strong> to <strong>i</strong> before adding <strong>-ly.</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>angry ---> angrily</li>
            <li>awkward ---> awkwardly</li>
            <li>careful ---> carefully</li>
            <li>crazy --->crazily</li>
            <li>fanciful --> fancifully</li>
            <li>final ---> finally</li>
            <li>fond ---> fondly</li>
            <li>greedy ---> greedily</li>
            <li>indigent --> indigently</li>
            <li>mafnificient --> amgnificiently</li>
            <li>numb --> numbly</li>
            <li>petulant --> petulantly</li>
            <li>strange --> strangely</li>
            <li>sure --> surely</li>
            <li>thoughtful --> thoughtfully</li>
            <li>truthful --> truthfully</li>
            <li>wise --> wisely</li>
          </ol>

          However, not every adjective has an adverb counterpart. There is no word <strong>bigly</strong> based on <strong>big</strong>
          and no word <strong>tinily</strong> based on <strong>tiny</strong>, but there is <strong>sillily</strong> based on <strong>silly</strong>.

          <br><br>Do watch out for adverbs that do not end in <strong>-ly</strong> at all. They are their own words without origins in the world
          of adjectives. Here are a few examples: again, now, then, too, very, away, quite, seldom. This list is by no means complete, and,
          if ever in doubt, you should consult your dictionary. It is the definitive source for identifying parts of speech.

          <h5>ADJECTIVES ENDING IN -LY</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> The same young man called back the next day and aasked, "What about lovely?
            That's an adjective, isn't it?"
            <br><br>
            <strong>Ans.</strong> This fellow had made another excellent point.The wary grammarian must never let his or her guard down. There are several adjectives that end in <strong>-ly</strong>
            : homely, lonely, manly, womanly. These are adjectives and adjectives only. Please note that this list is not complete.

          <h5>ADJECTIVE OR ADVERB?</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> A teacher at a portland elementary school asked, "Is early an adjective or an adverb?"
            <br><br>
            <strong>Ans.</strong> You must be careful with the modifier <strong>early</strong>. It is both an adjective and an adverb.
            Here are few more words that can be either adjectives or adverbs: cowardly, deep, early, friendly, hard, kindly, leisurely,
            lively, long, loud, only, and timely.
            <br> <br><br>
            We stopped at Bob's Pancake House for an <strong>early</strong> lunch. (adjective) <br>
            We rose <strong>early</strong> (adverb) <br>
            The band played a <strong>lively</strong> tune. (adjective) <br>
            Step <strong>lively</strong>, soldiers! (adverb)

        <div class="">
          <h5>HARD VS. HARDLY</h5>

          <p>
            <Strong>Q.</Strong> An English major at a colorado asked, "What is the difference between the words <strong>hard</strong>
            and <strong>hardly</strong>?" <br> <br>

            <strong>Ans.</strong> The caller was wondering about the difference between the adverbs <strong>hard</strong>
            and <strong>hardly.</strong> Remember that <strong>hard</strong> can aslo be an adjective. It is easy to think
            that <strong>hardly</strong>, the adverb from the adjective hard, retains the implication of rigidity or diligence
            of the adjective.

            <br><br>In fact, the definitions of the two words in question are quite different. As an adverb, <strong>hard</strong>
            means "firmly or diligently."<br><br>

            The novice skier fell <strong> hard</strong>.
            Jennifer thought <strong>hard</strong> on the matter. <br><br>

            The adverb <strong>hardly</strong> usualy means "barely or scarcely."<br>
            I <strong>hardly</strong> know her. <br>
            The mirror was <strong>hardly</strong> scratched.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Hardly</strong> can be used to mean "firmly or diligently," but the usage is rare. For this purpose, we often use the shorter version, <strong>hard.</strong>
          </p>
        </div><hr>

        <div class="">
          <h5>CATEGORIES OF ADVERBS</h5>

          <p>
            According to what meanings they convey, adverbs can fall into one of a number of general categories. Please note
            that the word lists follow each category title are only partial ones. <br> <br>
            <strong>Time:</strong> again, early, never, now, often, soon, then, today, tomorrow. <br>
            The plane landed five minutes <strong>early</strong>.
            <br>Our ship will come in <strong>soon.</strong><br> <br>

            <strong>Location or direction:</strong> above, away, below, down, here, in, inside, out, there, up <br>
            The sounds intensity rose <strong>above</strong> my threshold of apin. <br>
            We plan to stop <strong>here </strong> for the night.  <br><br>

            <strong>Manner: </strong> Cheerfully, cunningly, fast, quickly, right, slowly, well <br>
            The tortoise moves <strong>slowly</strong>. <br>
            The fox hunts <strong>cunningly</strong> <br><br>

            <strong>Degree: </strong> almost, entirely, little, much, rather, too, every <br>
            I am <strong>almost</strong> certain that she will be there. <br>
            There are too many bagel shops in my neighbourhood. <br><br>

            <strong>Reaosn: </strong> so, why <br>
            I don't think <strong>so.</strong> <br>
            <strong>Why</strong> did she say that? <br><br>

            <strong>Number: </strong>first, once, second, twice, third, thrice <br>
            We were here <strong>first</strong>.
            I will only say this <strong>once.</strong>

        <div class="">
          <h5>LOT</h5>

          <p>
            <strong> Q. </strong> A travel agent asked, "What kind of wordis <strong>lot?</strong> Someone asked me, 'Are a lot more Californians
            travelling this year?' It got me thinking, and I wanted to find out." <br><br>

            <strong>Ans. </strong> <strong>Lot</strong> is usually a noun, meaning "a large amount," "One's for tune,"
            or "a share." <br><br>

            My uncle has a <strong>lot</strong> of money. <br>
            Accept your <strong>lot</strong> in life. <br>
            I  inherited the <strong>lot</strong> on the corner <br><br>

            <strong>Lot</strong> can be used as an adverb in sentences such as the one our travel agent offered. There, it means "very many." In her
            sentence, the adjective <strong>more</strong> modifies the noun <strong>Californians.</strong> The adverb <strong>lot</strong> modifies <strong>more</strong>.

          <h3 class="text-uppercase">Degree of comparision </h3>

          <p>
            Like adjectives, adverbs are simple bunch. They do not trouble us with gender, number, person, or case issues.
            These properties do not command confusing from changes in adverbs. <br>
            Adverb do change with comparisio. Like adjectives, they have three forms of compariosins: <strong>positive, comparitive, and superlative</strong>.
            The functions and characteristics of each category are the same as they were for the adjectives. The positive degree expresses the quality without comparision.
            The comparative degree compare two verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. The suparlative degree comapre three or more verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Adjectives and adverbs are compared by the same methods.
            The forms of comparision for adverbs can be created by using a suffix or an adverb.
          </p>

          <h5>ADVERB COMPARISION</h5>
          <p>
            Most adverbs are compared by using another adverb. Use <strong>more</strong> or <strong>less</strong> for the comparative forms and <strong>most</strong>
            or <strong>least</strong> for the suparlative forms. <br> <br> </p>

            <h5>SUFFIX COMPARISION</h5>

            <p>
              There are a few adverbs that are compared by using a suffix. Use <strong> -er</strong> for the comparative forms and
              <strong>-est</strong> for the suparlative forms. These appear identical to their adjective counterparts, but, as adverbs, They
              are different in function.

              <h5>IRREGULAR DISTINCTIONS</h5>

              <p>
                <strong>Q. </strong>The same pennsylvania teacher we met in chapter 3 said, "I know that the adjective
                <strong>far</strong> and its forms of comparision can also be adverbs. DO they have the same meaning as they did
                when they were adjectives?" <br><br>

                <strong>Ans.</strong> The delightful woman had brought up a great point about the forms of adverbs irregularly compared.
                In some caess, adverbs in the comparative and suparlative degrees can  take different forms.
                Which form you use depends upon the meaning you want to convey. <br><br>

                The adverbs in the <strong>far -> farther -> farthest</strong> progression refer to physical distance. <br>

                <br>I ran <strong>farther</strong> than I ever had before. <br>
                The adverbs in the <strong>far -> further -> furthest</strong> progression refer a mental or physical distance. <br>
                 We cannot travel any <strong>further</strong> tonight. (physical distance) <br>
                 Each day of my vacation, thoughts of work are drifting <strong>further</strong> from my mind. (mental distance) <br><br>

                 The adverbs in the <strong>late -> later -> latest</strong> progression refer to order in time. <br>

                 We arrived <strong>later</strong> than usual. <br>

                 The adverbs in the <strong>late -> latter -> last</strong> progression refer to a physical order in space. <br>

                 Bob stood <strong>last</strong> in the line for the concert tickets.

              </p>

              <h5>ADVERBS BEYOND COMPARISION</h5>

              <p>
                There are many adverbs that are never comapred. They desceibe one-diamensional qualities unfit for comparision. Here are some examples.
                <ul>
                  <li>again</li>
                  <li>ever</li>
                  <li>now</li>
                  <li>thus</li>
                  <li>almost</li>
                  <li>here</li>
                  <li>past</li>
                  <li>too</li>
                  <li>back</li>
                  <li>never</li>
                  <li>so</li>
                  <li>twice</li>
                  <li>before</li>
                  <li>no</li>
                  <li>then</li>
                  <li>very</li>
                  <li>by</li>
                  <li>not</li>
                  <li>there</li>
                  <li>yes</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                How can one event occur "more twice" than another? The concept of comparision just doesn't
                make sense when applied to these adverbs.
              </p>

              <h5>MORE THOROUGHLY TESTED?</h5>

              <p>
                <strong>Q. </strong>"Can you say that one product is more thoroughly tested
                than another?" asked a chemist for a large pharmaceutical
                company. <br> <br>
                <strong>Ans. </strong>
                The adverb <strong>thoroughly</strong> means "completely." Some might
                express concern over the logic behind the phrase <strong>more thoroughly
                tested </strong>. These critics will claim that the quality expressed by
                this adverb has only one degree. All things thorough are equally
                thorough, and all things done thoroughly are done equally thor-
                oughly. If Product A has been "more thoroughly" tested than
                Product B, Product B was not thoroughly tested to begin with.
                Under this interpretation, the chemist should change his phrasin
                to indicate that one product was tested thoroughly while another
                was not
                However, language is a tool, and the purpose of this tool is to
                communicate. The phrase <strong>more thoroughly tested</strong> communicates
                a very clear idea. One product has been better tested than another.
                Though <strong>thoroughly</strong> is, in a rigid way, beyond comparison, the
                phrase <strong>more thoroughly</strong> does not mislead. The testing of one product
                 more closely approximates the perfect state of thoroughness
                than another. The chemist may state that one product is moe
                throughly tested than another without fear of reproach.

        <div class="">
          <h3>POSITIONING THE ADVERB</h3>

          <p>
            Adverbs are mobile words. Where an adverb is positioned
            depends on what type of word it modifies and on how the speaker
            wishes to communicate his or her idea. When an adverb modifies
            an adjective or another adverb, the modifying adverb wil
            precede the word modified. <br><br>

            We are <strong>quite</strong> happy with the new apartment. <br>
            My sister drives <strong>so</strong> recklessly. <br><br>

            In the first example, the adverb <strong>quite</strong> precedes the adjective that it
            modifies, happy. In the second, the adverb <strong>so</strong> precedes the adverb
            that it modifies, recklessly. <br> <br>

            The plot thickens when the adverb modifies a verb. These
            adverbs may occupy a number of different positions within the
            sentence. They may directly follow the verbs modified. <br> <br>

            Lara aimed <strong>carefully</strong> at the target. <br>
            Jack stepped <strong>gingerly</strong> across the broken glass. <br> <br>

            In these two examples, the adverbs <strong>carefully</strong> and <strong>gingerly</strong> follow
            the verbs that they modify, <strong>aimed</strong> and <strong>stepped</strong>. <br><br>

            Though the adverb may follow the verb, an object or phrase
            can sometimes come between the two. Here, the adverb will not
            directly follow the verb. <br><br>

            The bomb squad lifted the explosive <strong>carefully</strong>. <br>
            I watched the game <strong>intently</strong>. <br> <br>

            In the first example, the adverb <strong>carefully</strong> modifies the verb <strong>lifted</strong>.
            An article, <strong>the</strong>, and a direct object, <strong>explosive</strong>, separate <strong>carefully</strong>
            from the verb. In the second example, the adverb <strong>intently</strong> modifies
            the verb <strong>watched</strong>. An article, <strong>the</strong>, and a direct object, <strong>game</strong>,
            separate <strong>intently</strong> from the verb. <br>

            The adverb may also lie within a verb phrase although it is not
            a part of the verb phrase. <br> <br>

            The syndicate does <strong>not ordinarily</strong> give retun. <br>
            They will <strong>definitely</strong> feel offended. <br> <br>

            In the first example, the adverbs <strong>ordinarily</strong> and <strong>not</strong> fall inside the verb phrase that they modify, <strong>does give</strong>.
            In the second example, the adverb <strong>definitely</strong> lies within the verb phrase that it modifies, <strong>will feel.</strong><br>

            The adverb may preceds the verb. It can begin the sentence, or it can just appear just after the suject. In either case, the positioning emphasizes the quality
            descibed by the adverbs. <br> <br>

            <strong>Often,</strong> I take a nap during my lunch break. <br>
            she <strong>always</strong> arrives earlier than is necessary. <br><br>

            In the first example, the adverb <strong>often</strong> modifies the verb <strong>take</strong> and begins the sentence.
            In the second example, the adverb <strong>always</strong> modifies the verb <strong>arrives</strong>. It falls after the subject
            but before the verb. In both examples, the position emphasize the particular qualities of the adverb. <br>

            As a general rule, it is wise to place the adverb as near as possible to the word that modified. Tightening the space between the
            modifier and the word modified reduces the chances of mistakenly linking the modifier with a word modified it was not intended to modify.

            <br><br>I lost <strong>almost </strong>a full pint of blood. <br>
            I <strong>almost</strong> lost a full pint of blood. <br>

            In the first exampple, it appears taht the adverb <strong>almost </strong> modifies the adjective <strong>full</strong>
            . The sentence indicates that someone lost a little less than a full pint of blood. In the second example, the adverb <strong>almost</strong>
            appears to modify the verb <strong>lost</strong>. The sentence indicates that someone came close to losing a pint of blood but did not lose ant at all.
            The position of adverb has a drastic effect on the meaning of the sentence. Be sure that your choice of placement creates the meaning you intend.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-uppercase">Poor Modification</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Q. </strong>A teacher asked, "What would you do with this sentence? 'Many people enjoy eating simply for pleasure.' One of my students wrote it in health report." <br>
            <br><strong>Ans. </strong> It's difficult to tell which word the adverb <strong>simply</strong> modifies. It could modify the gerund <strong>eating</strong>
            . We would then assume that many people enjoy eating in a simple manner. The adverb could also modify the prepositional phrase <strong>for pleasure.</strong>
            The phrase serves an adverb function since it modifies <strong>eating.</strong> It tells why people eat. It <strong>simply</strong>
            modifies this phrase, then we assume that many people eat just for the pleasure of eat. The adverb <strong> simply</strong>
            is synonymous with the adverb <strong>just</strong> in this context. Whatever the case, the sentence needs rewarding to create a clearer meaning. It
            could read, "Many people enjoys eating just for the pleasure of it." <br>
           </p>

           <h5>MORE POOR MODIFICATION</h5>

           <p>
             <strong>When a close friend's motehr passed away, the funeral home sent him some literature explaining embalming.</strong>
              He shared the pamphlet read, "The consent form is required to be completed when obtaining the necesarry express authorization to embalm orally by telephone." <br><br>

              <strong>Ans.</strong> <strong>By telephone</strong> is a prepostional phrase. It appears to modify to modify the adverb <strong>orally</strong>.
              The adverb appears to modify the infinitive <strong>to embalm</strong>. As limited as my knowledge of mortuary science is, I amcertain that one cannot embalm the body over the phone. The process is quite complex.
              The adverb <strong>orally</strong> should modify the gerund phrase <strong>obtaining the necesarry express authorization</strong>
              . We need to move the adverb and clean up a bit of messy writing. The senetence should read, "the consent from must be completed when orally obtaining the necesarry express authorization to embalm."

           </p>

           <h5>FROM MY FILES: COLLOQUIALISMS</h5>

           <p>
             Language is full of irregularities. Carelessness and common usage often bring statements with serious grammatical flaws into everyday speech. When they become common, we assume that they are correct.
             Two of these, <strong>rest easy</strong> and <strong>cleat-cut</strong>, have been inspirations for numerous calls to the Hot Line. <strong>Easy</strong> and <strong>clear</strong>
             are both adjectives, capable of modifying nouns and pronouns only. <br>
             <strong>Rest</strong> and <strong>cut</strong> are both verbs. Each requires an adverb modifier. <strong>Rest easy</strong> becomes
             <strong>Rest easily</strong>, and clear-cut becomes clearly-cut. <br>

             The dictionary does list <strong>clear-cut</strong> as an adjective, first used in 1855, <strong>clearly-cut</strong> and
             <strong>rest-easily</strong> are technically correct. However, <strong>clear-cut</strong> and <strong>rest easy</strong> are
             also accepatable simply because they are in common use. Colloquial expressions such as these challenge the grammarian who must walk a narrow line between colloquially and grammatically correct English.
             In school, as well as in the professional world, colloquial English should always take a back seat to that which is grammatically correct.
           </p>

        <div class="">
          <h3>THE TRUTH ABOUT ADVERBS AND ADJECTIVES</h3>
          <p>
            Because they are both modifiers, it can be difficult to determine whether to use an adverb or an adjective. The first step in marketing
            the decision is determining whay you need at that point in the sentence. Do you need a word to modify a noun or pronoun? If so,
            use an adjective. Do you need a word to modify a verb, an adjective, or an adverb?if so, use an adverb. <br><br>

            There are situtaions, however, where such simple problem solving is not enough. Most adverb/adjective mistakes are made when the modifier follows the verb. Here are two tips that will help
            the watchful grammarian avoid this pitfall. <br>

            <strong>TIP1 - </strong> Do not use an adjevtive immediately after an action ver. Only adverbs modify action verbs. These sentence have been written correctly. <br> <br>

            My brother walks <strong>strange</strong>. (incorrect) <br>
            Wendy writes <strong>careful</strong>. (incorrect) <br>
            Sue talks <strong>soft</strong>. (incorrect) <br> <br>

            In each example, the author has mistakenly modified an action verb with an adjective. We need to change the adjectives into adverb. These
            sentences should appear as follow. <br><br>

            My brother walks <strong>strangely</strong>. (incorrect) <br>
            Wendy writes <strong>carefully</strong>. (incorrect) <br>
            Sue talks <strong>softly</strong>. (incorrect) <br> <br>

            <strong>TIP2 - </strong> Beware of action verbs posing as linking verbs. Think back to our discussion of verbs. Some action verbs,
            such as <strong>smell, taste, look, and appear</strong>, can be used as linking verbs. A modifier that follows a linking verb is a subject complement. It comlements or  modifies the subject of
            the sentence, a noun, pronoun, or other nominal, and therfore, must be an adjective. <br><br>

            The ivy grew <strong>high</strong>. <br>
            The ivy grows <strong>quickly</strong>. <br><br>

            In the first example, the verb <strong>grew</strong> is a linking verb. The modifier that follows, a subject complement, refers to the subject. The adjective <strong>high</strong> describe the noun  <strong>ivy</strong>.
            It indicates how large the ivy grows. The usage is correct. <br>

            In the second example, the verb <strong>grows</strong> is an action verb. The modifier that follows refers to the verb and should
            be an adverb. Here, the adverb <strong>quickly</strong> describes the verb <strong>grows</strong>. In indicates the manner in which the plant
            grows. This usage is correct as well but instills the sentence with a very different meaning. <br>
          </p>

          <h5>THE DEATH OF ADVERBS</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q. </strong> One of the "A" students in my English class asked, "Are adverbs being subjugated by adjectives?" <br><br>

            <strong>Ans.</strong> I am sorry to say that, in common language, adverbs are being overrun by adjectives. Look at these sentence written
            on final essay for one of my classes: "Everyone seems to think higher of the President now." <strong>Higher</strong> is an adjective. It cannot modify
            the infinitive <strong>to think</strong>. the sentence should read, "Everyone thinks more highly of the President now." <br>
            <br>Adjectives have not taken over, but we do need to concentrate on the proper use od adverbs. One caller heard an actor in a commercial say, "Does your
            scalp itch so bad?" The adjective <strong>bad</strong> has taken the place of adverb. The actor should have asked if her friend's scalp itched <i>badly</i>.
            By the way, this caller commented that his scalp did't itch so badly that he'd trade an adjective for an adverbs. <br>
          </p>

          <h5>BIBLICAL VS. BIBLICALLY</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q. </strong> A Bible school instructor needed an interpretation. He said, "I heard the phrase 'to think and act biblical.' should it be
            <strong>biblical or biblically</strong>?" <br><br>

            <strong>Ans. </strong> The adjective <strong>biblical</strong> modifies nouns and pronouns, informing us that they are related to the bible. The adverb <strong>biblically</strong>
            modifies verbs, adjectives, and otehr adverbs. An act done biblically is done in a biblically manner. In the caller's phrase, the word in question modifies a compound infinitive.
            <strong>to think and act.</strong> Since an infinitive is a verbal of verb form, it requires an adverb modifier. The correct
            phrasing, therefore, is "to think and act biblically." <br>
          </p>

          <h5>FAIR VS. FAIRLY</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q. </strong> "Can people be treated fair?" asked a studious caller who was working on term paper. <br><br>
            <strong>Ans.</strong> Fair is an adjective. The modifier in question describes a verb phrase, <strong> be treated</strong>
            . The sentence requires an adverb to modified this action verb. People are terated fairly. <br><br>
          </p>

          <h5>HEALTHY, HEALTHIER, OR HEALTHILY</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q. </strong> The owner of a health food store asked, "Which is correct? 'They are eating healthy' or 'They are eating healthier'?" <br><br>

            <strong>Ans. </strong> BOTH sentence are wrong. Each uses an adjective to describe the manner in which people eat. In the first sentence, the adjevtive <strong>healty</strong>
            in the positive degree, modifies the verb phrases <strong>are eating</strong>. In the second, the adjective <strong>healthier</strong>
            , in the comparative degree, modifies the verb phrases <strong>are eating</strong>. Only adverb modify verbs. The store owner can use "They are eating healthily" or "They are eating more healthily." <strong>Healthily</strong>
            is an adverb. If he insist on using adjectives, he can say, "They are eating healthy foods" or "They are eating healthier foods."
          </p>

          <h5>QUICK VS. QUICKLY</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q. </strong> A nurse at a local medical center wanted to know if her supervising doctor knew his grammar. She said, "Yesterday,
            when we were examining a patient, he said, 'It's happening too quick.' Did he speak correctly?" <br><br>

            <strong>Ans. </strong> The doctor made a common mistake. He used an adjective, <strong>quick,</strong> in place of an adverb. The doctor should have said, "It's happening too quickly."
             The word <strong> quickly</strong> is an adverb. It modifies the verb phrase is <strong>happening</strong>. <br>
          </p>

          <h5>DRINKING, DRIVING, AND ADVERBS</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q. </strong>A caller with a social conscience called to ask if the slogan for a prominent organization contained an error in grammar
            She said, "You know that line 'Friends don't let Friends
            drunk.' Is "drunk" correct?" <br><br>

            <strong>Ans. </strong> The author of the saying used an adjective, drunk, to
            describe a verb, drive. He needs an adverb. With perfect
            grammar, the slogan might read, "Friends don't let friends drive
            drunkenly." <br>

            However, some might claim that the modifier is not acting on
            the verb at all. Instead, it modifies an understood but unwritten
            pronoun, they. If the slogan were written without the missing
            words, it might read, "Friends don't let friends drive when they are
            drunk." In this sentence, the adjective <strong>drunk</strong> is a subject comple-
            ment. It complements the subject of the subordinate clause, <strong>they</strong>
            The new sentence makes for an awkward slogan, so we would
            quite rightly eliminate the added words. This does not change the
            fact that the adjective drunk could be correct. <br>

            <h5>TIGHT vs. TIGHTLY</h5>

            <p>
              <strong>Q. </strong>
              "I have a sign on the door of my library that reads, 'Please
              close the door tight,' " commented a librarian from a mountain
              community. "It gets cold up here in the Rockies in the winter
              and we don't need anyone letting in the ice and snow. A client told
              me that the sign should say, 'Please close the door tightly.' Which
              do you think is right?'" <br> <br>
              <strong>Ans. </strong>
              This modifier puzzle has no right or wrong answer. Both the
              client and the librarian are correct but for different reasons.
              Which version to choose is a matter of preference. If we prefer the
              librarian's version, then the adjective <strong>tight</strong> is an object complement
              , describing the direct object <strong>door</strong>. The complement indicates
              the condition of the door once it is closed. If we prefer the client's
              version, then <strong>tightly</strong> is an adverb, modifying the verb <strong>close</strong>. The
              adverb describes the manner of the closing action. In either case,
              the important thing is not to let the door swing open.

            <h5>KEY ADVERB/ ADJECTIVE DISTICTIIONS </h5>

            <p>
              There are several pairs of related adjpectives and adverbs that
              can puzzle even the most studious grammarian. Let's allow a few
              calls to The National Grammar Hot Line to clarity the issues.
            </p>

            <h5>BAD VS. BADLY</h5>

            <p>
              <strong>Q. </strong> Do children behave bad or bally" asked a weary, but stil grammar-conscious
              parent. <br><br>
              <strong>Ans. </strong>I told the caller that children behave badly and wished her well
              with the incorrigible youths. Her question had hit upon an impor-
              tant distinction that most of us fail to make. Too many amateur
              rammarians use the adjective bad to modify an action verb when
              they need the adverb <strong>badly</strong>. <br> <br>

              The children behaved bad in school today. (incorrecet) <br><br>

              In this sentence, the adjective <strong>bad</strong> modifies the action verb
              <strong>behaved</strong>. Modifiers of verbs are adverbs, but the word <strong>bad</strong> is not
              and will never be an adverb. The sentence should read as follows: <br><br>
              The children behaved badly in school today. (corect) <br>
              This sentence uses an adverb, <strong>badly</strong>, the proper part of speech, to
              modify a verb, <strong>behaved</strong>.
            </p>

            <h5>GooD vs. WELL</h5>
            <p>
              <strong>Q. </strong>
              "Should I say, 'We played well' or We played good?"
              inquired a caller with a penchant for basketball. <br><br>

              After commending her on a game well played, I informed
              her that she should say. "We played well." <strong>Good</strong> and <strong>well</strong>
              may be the two most misused words in the English language.
              <strong>Good</strong> is an adjective. It can only modify nouns and pronouns. <strong>Well</strong>
              is an adverb. It can only modify verbs, adjectives, and other
              adeterbs. Too many people use <strong>good</strong>, the adjective, when they need
              <strong>well</strong>, the adverb. <br><br>

              I scored <strong>good</strong> on my spelling test. (incorrect) <br>
              The new car runs <strong>good</strong>. (incorrecet) <br><br>
              In each example, the adjective <strong>good</strong> modifies a verb, <strong>scored</strong> and
              <strong>runs</strong>,
              respectively. Only adverbs modify verbs. These situations
              all for the adverb <strong>well</strong>. <br><br>

              I scored <strongwell>well</strong> on my spelling test. (correct) <br>
              The new cer runs <strong>well</strong>. (correct) <br><br>

              A freguetly used expression, "to feel well," in American parlance,
              implies thet one's touching ability is in excellent condition.

            <h5>Goop vs. WELL REVISITED  </h5>
			
			
			<p>
				<strong>Q. </strong>
				"Is, 'We did good' a correct statement? My grandma keeps telling me that <strong>good</strong> is wrong" said a high school student. <br><br>
				<strong>Ans. </strong>
				Grandmas are very wise. <strong>Good</strong> is an adjective. It can only
				describe a noun or a pronoun. The sentence needs a modier 
				to describe the verb <strong>did</strong>, an action verb. The correct word choice
				would place the adverb <strong>well</strong> after the verb. The student amended
				his statement to "We did well." Of course, the Hot Line understood
				that he was speaking colloquially but why not use the right form?
			</p>
			
			<h5>REAL VS. VERY  </h5>
			
			
			<p>
				<strong>Q. </strong>
				A parent concerned about
				his son's grammar called to ask,
				"How do I explain to my son the difference between real and
				very? I don't want him to say things like 'I played real well,' but I don't know how to explain 
				the distinction between the words."<br><br>
				
				<strong>Ans. </strong>
				I love it when I get calls from parents concerned about their
				. children's grammar. It gives me hope for the future and a
				strong sense of purpose. I thanked the man for his call and gave
				him the words to make the distinction. <strong>Real</strong> is an adjective mean
				ing "actual or genuine." <strong>Very</strong> is an adverb meaning "quite or
				extremely" It is an all too common error to use real when the situation
				demands <strong>very</strong>. <br><br>
				
				I am <strong>real</strong> glad you made it. (incorrect)<br>
				The pie smells <strong>real</strong> good. (incorrect) <br><br>
				
				In these examples, the adjective <strong>real</strong> is used to modify other adjectives
				, <strong>glad</strong> and <strong>good</strong>, but an adjective can only modify a noun or a
				pronoun. The sentences should look like the following: <br><br>
				
				I am <strong>very</strong> glad you made it. (correct)<br>
				The pie smells <strong>very</strong> good. (correct) <br><br>
				
				In these examples, the adverb <strong>very</strong> modifies the adjectives as only
				an adverb can. <br>
				
				The adverb <strong>really</strong> is derived from the adjective <strong>real</strong>. It means
				"actually or truly" but is frequently used in place of the adverb <strong>very</strong>. <br><br>
				
				I am <strong>really</strong> glad you made it. (acceptable) <br>
				The pie smells <strong>really</strong> good. (acceptable)<br><br>
				
				While this usage is not incorrect, the adverbs <strong>very</strong> and really</strong> have
				subtle differences in meaning that are worthy of note. <strong>Very</strong>
				involves an extreme, while <strong>really</strong> involves truth. They are similar
				but not the same. Be aware of the difference. Say what you mean!

			<h3>SOME OTHER THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT ADVERBS</h3>
			
			<p>
			These are a few points to note about adverbs on your journey
			to becoming a grammar maven. 
			</p><br><br>
			
			<h5>OTHER KINDS oF ADVERBS</h5>
			
			<p>
				Some adverbs fall into one of two special classes: <strong>interrogative
				adverbs</strong> and <strong>negative/affirmative adverbs</strong>. 
			</p><br><br>
			
			<h5 class="text-uppercase"> Interogative ADVERBS</h5>
			<p>
				The interrogative adverbs are used at the beginnings of sentences
				to ask questions. The words <strong>how, when, where, and why</strong>
				are the most common of this type. <br><br>
				
				<strong>How</strong> much do you know about this insidious plot? <br>
				<strong>When</strong> do you expect the plane to arrive?<br>
				<strong>Where</strong> did she say she was going?<br>
				<strong>Why</strong> do you think that?<br><br>
				
				In the first example, the adverb <strong>how</strong> asks the question and modifies 
				the adverb <strong>much</strong>. The question is one of degree. The adverb
				<strong>how</strong> can also ask questions of manner or quality as in "How did
				you do that?" or "How was the play?" In the second example, the
				adverb <strong>when</strong> asks the question and modifies the verb <strong>expect</strong>. The
				question involves time. In the third example, the adverb <strong>where</strong>
				asks the question and modifies the verb phrase <strong>did say</strong>. The question
				is one of location. In the final example, the adverb <strong>why</strong> asks
				the question and modifies the verb phrase <strong>do think</strong>. The question
				involves cause.
			</p>
			
			<h5>NEGATIVE/AFFIRMATIVE ADVERBS</h5>
			
			<p>
				The negative and affirmative adverbs answer questions.
				negative adverbs are <strong>no</strong> and <strong>not</strong>. The affirmative
				adverbs is <strong>yes</strong>. The adverb <strong>yes</strong> and <strong>no</strong> stand independently
				from the remainder of the sentence and are usually set off by commas. <br><br>
		
		
				<strong>No</strong>, you may not pet the cheetah. <br>
				<strong>Yes</strong>, I saw the preliminary report. <br>
				<strong>No</strong>, that is not what I meant. <br>
				<strong>Yes</strong>, Carol is joining us for dinner. <br><br>
				
				As independent elements, <strong>yes</strong> and <strong>no</strong> can express complete 
				ideas on their own. For instance, if someone asks me, "Do
				enjoy baseball?" I can respond, "Yes," and still express a complete
				idea. I could have answered, "I enjoy baseball" or "Yes,I enjoy
				baseball," but the simple, one-word, adverb answer imparts an
				identical message. <br><br>
				
				The negative adverb <strong>not</strong> is often positioned between words in
				a verb phrase but is not a part of the verb phrase. It is an independent 
				adverb whose function is to switch the meaning of the
				verb to its exact opposite. <br><br>
				
				Brian will <strong>not</strong> tell me where we are going. <br>
				I have <strong>not</strong> given my approval to the project. <br>
				Clarisse was <strong>not</strong> the culprit. <br><br>
				
				In the first example, the adverb <strong>not</strong> modifies the verb phrase <strong>will
				tell</strong>. Because of <strong>not</strong>, Brian refuses to reveal their destination. In the
				second example, <strong>not</strong> modifies the verb phrase <strong>have given</strong>, and its
				presence indicates that I have yet to offer any approval. In the final
				example, <strong>not</strong> modifies the verb <strong>was</strong>. Clarisse's innocence hangs on
				the presence of the adverb.
			</p>
			
			<h5>INDEPENDENT ADVERBS</h5>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Q. </strong>A fan of war movies wondered, "What part of speech is <strong>forward</strong>
				when the captains yells, 'Forward! March!' at
				troops?" <br><br>
		
				<strong></strong>In that command, the word <strong>forward</strong> is an adverb. English
				speakers have been known, on occasion, to use single adverb as 
				independent exclamations. The practice is not common.
				The last such utterances I heard came from a grizzled sea captain
				and a sergeant major in the United States Marine Corps. The captain
				yelled, "Away!" and his crew set sail. The sergeant major
				hollered, "Forward!" and his troops marched into the desert. The
				adverbs <strong>away</strong> and <strong>forward</strong> are complete thoughts unto them
				selves. They are abbreviated versions of more traditionally complete
				 sentences, and their meanings are obvious in the contexts in
				which they are spoken. The sea captain is actually telling his crew
				"Sail away!" The sergeant major is commanding his troops,"March
				forward!" Captains and commanders are often people of few
				words and prefer the shortened or elliptical approach to speech.

			</p>
			
			<h5>DOUBLE NEGATIVES</h5>
			
			<p>
				One of the defining characteristics of nonstandard English is
				the use of the double negative. In the double negative construction
				two negative words are used to make a positive. Used correctly
				with the adverbs <strong>no</strong> and <strong>not</strong>, the double negative can place emphasis
				 on an idea or a phrase. <br><br>
				  
				There is no way we can not go on this trip.<br><br>
				
				Using the sentence above is equivalent to writing. "We must go on
				this trip. " The writer has chosen to emphasize the fact that no way
				exists to prevent him and his compatriots from traveling so he uses
				the double negative. Such usage is justifiable. <br>
				
				However, the double negative is too often used with the intention
				 of expressing a negative idea. Speakers forget that one nega-
				tive word expresses one negative idea and that two negative words
				express a positive idea. <br><br>
				
				We <strong>can't hardly</strong> wait for Christmas. (incorrect) <br>
				I <strong>haven't barely</strong> started to think about the wedding.
				(incorrect) <br><br>
				
				In the first example, the speaker intends to say that he or she is
				eager for Christmas, but the double negative formed by the two
				negative words <strong>can't</strong> and <strong>hardly</strong> indicates that he or she doesn't
				much care when the holiday comes around. In the second example
				the speaker wants to say that he or she has not thought about the
				wedding yet, but the double negative formed by the negative
				words <strong>haven't</strong> and <strong>barely</strong> indicates that he or she has to
				deal of time thinking over the matter. Here are the sentence
				correctly written with a single negative: <br><br>
				We <strong>can hardly</strong> wait for Christmas. (correct) <br>
				I <strong>have barely</strong> started to think about tbe wedding. (correct)

			</p>
			
			<h5>PERPETUATING THE DOUBLE NEGATIVE</h5>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Q. </strong>The caller, a widely-syndicated writer, had read a
				paraphrase of a quote. The original quotation read, "They won't
				never talk." The paraphrase read, "They said that they won't
				talk." The columnist asked, "Should he have perpetuated the
				grammatical error in the original quote?" <br><br>
				
				<strong>Ans. </strong>
				This wily columnist recognized the misuse of the double
				negative found in both the paraphrase and the orignal quotation.
				The double negative in the phrase <strong>won't (will not never
				talk</strong> reverses the intended meaning of the statement. The oniginal
				author meant to say that they will never talk. With the double negative,
				it is certain that they will. <br>
				
				The columnist and I both agreed that the paraphrase should
				have been written with correct grammar. If the writer wanted to
				quote directly and keep the error, he could have used the notation
				<strong>[sic]</strong>. The presence of <strong>[sic]</strong> within a quotation indicates that a pas
				sage, sentence, phrase, or word was written as intended, even
				though it may contain an error or peculiarity. The armended paraphrase
				would read, "They won't never [sic) talk." Notice that <strong>[sic]</strong>
				is enclosed in brackets. By the way, did you know that a metapiaras
				is a word-for-word translation while a paraphrase is simply an inter
				pretation and general rewording?
				<br>
				
			</p>
			
			<h5>ADVERBIALS</h5>
			<p>
				Contemporary grammarians use the term <strong>adverbial</strong> to describe
				sentence elements that perform the same functions as normal
				adverbs. This element commonly appears in the form of an adverb phrase, a noun phrase, or a prepostional phrase and often
				indicates time, place, manner, or reason. <br><br>
				
				Our plane lands <strong>late Tuesday night.</strong> <br>
				We rode our bikes <strong>to the beach</strong>. <br>
				She sings <strong>quite dreadfully.</strong> <br>
				<strong>Exhausted</strong>, the triathlete collapsed a mere fifty yards from
				the finish line. <br><br>
				
				In the first example, the adverbial <strong>late Tuesday night</strong>, a noun
				phrase, modifies the verb <strong>lands</strong>. It tells us when the plane will
				land. In the second example, the adverbial <strong>to the beach</strong>, a prepositional 
				phrase, modifies the verb <strong>rode</strong>. It indicates the place we rode
				our bikes to. In the third example, the adverbial <strong>quite dreadfully</strong>,
				an adverb phrase, modifies the verb <strong>sings</strong>. It indicates the manner
				in which she sings. In the fourth example, the adverbial <strong>exhausted</strong>
				a past participle, modifies the verb <strong>collapsed</strong>. It indicates the reason that the
				triathlete collapsed. <br><br>
				
				When a sentence is incomplete or ungrammatical without an
				adverbial, we call this element an <strong>adverbial complement</strong>. <br><br>
				
				They are <strong>in the gym.</strong> <br>
				The town lies <strong>one hundred miles north of Los Angeles.</strong> <br><br>
				
				In each example, the adverbial complement is a necessary part of
				the sentence. In the first example, the adverbial complement <strong>in the
				gym</strong> completes the meaning of the verb <strong>are</strong>. In the second example
				the adverbial complement <strong>one hundred miles north of Los
				Angeles</strong> completes the meaning of the verb <strong>lies</strong>.
			</p>
				
				


			<h5>ADVERBS MODIFYING PRONOUNS</h5>
			
			<p>
			On occasion, we find a word that we would typically identify
			as an adverb functioning as an adjective or, as contemporary grammarians
			would have it, a determiner to modify a pronoun. <br><br>
			
			We lost <strong>almost</strong> everything. <br>
			<strong>Hardly</strong> anyone recognizes me with this new hairstyle. <br><br>
			
			In the first example, <strong>almost</strong>, a word which we would typicall
			an adverb, modifies the pronoun <strong>everything</strong>. In the second example, <strong>hardly</strong>, 
			another word which we would typically call an
			adverb, modifies the pronoun <strong>anyone</strong>.
		
			
			</p>

			<h5>REDUNDANT MODIERS</h5>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Q.</strong> A very sick patient heard his doctor say, "You have a cough
				that's always chronic." The patient asked, "Did he need to
				use <strong>always</strong>? It sounds unnecessary to me." <br><br>
				
				The use of always is redundant. Both chronic and always
				e mean "continuing or constant." If something is chronic, it is
				always present by definition. The doctor only needed to say, "You
				have a chronic cough."
			</p>
			
			<h5>FROM MY FILES: Too MANY ADVERBS</h5>
			
			<p>
			Author Woolcott Gibbs once complained, "Writers always use
			too damn many adverbs. On one page recently, I found eleven
			modifying the verb." Woolcott went on to say that "a writer who
			can't make his context indicate the way his character is talking
			ought to be in another line of work." Watch your adverbs. Only
			modify those words that need modifiers (as reported in James
			Thurber's The Years with Ross).
