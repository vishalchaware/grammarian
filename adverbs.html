      <h1 class="text-center">Adverbs</h1>

      <div class="border p-4 mt-3 h5 Ubuntu text-center">
        Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or, other adverbs.
      </div>

      <div class="mt-3">
        Adjectives are not the only modifiers in the world of grammar. Just as nouns and pronouns sometimes require
        description, so do verbs and adjectives. For this descriptive purpose, language include adverbs. Adverbs modify
        verbs, adjectives, and even other adverbs. As modifiers of verbs, they indicate when, where, how, or how often an action
        is performed.<br><br>
        they'll arrive <strong>soon</strong>. (when) <br>
        Put the flowers <strong>here</strong>. (where) <br>
        She dances <strong> awkwardly</strong> y. (how) <br>
        Cynthia travels <strong>frequently </strong>.(how) <br><br>

        In the first example, the adverb <strong>soon</strong> modifies the verb arrive. It tells when the arrival
        will occur. In the second, the adverb <strong>here</strong> modifies the verb put. It tells where the flowers should
        be placed. In the third, the adverb   <strong>awkwardly</strong> modifies the verb dances. It tells how she dances.
        In the final example, the adverb frequently modifies the verb <stong>travels</stong>. It tells how often Cynthia travels.<br><br>

        As you now know, adverbs do not only modifies only verbs. They also describes adjectives and other adverbs.<br><br>

        Kareem Abdul Jabar is <strong>extremely </strong> tall.<br>
        Anthony sings <strong>quite</strong>  exquisitely.  <br><br>

        In the first example, the adverb extremely modifies the adjective <strong>tall</strong>. It indicates how tall kareem is.
        In the second example, the adverb <strong>quite</strong> modifies the adverb <strong>exquisitely </strong>
        . It indicates how exquisite Anthony's singing is. Incidentlly, the adverb exquisitely modifies the verb sings. It tells
        how Anthony sings. <hr>
        <div class="">
          <h5 class="">AN ADVERB QUESTION</h5>
          <strong>Q.</strong>   An editor of a dictionary was writing its foreword. He called about the sentence "The world is a much different place
          from what it was fifty years ago." The editor asked, "What do you think of the use of <strong>much</strong> in the sentence? I thinkit sounds funny." <br>
          <strong> Ans.</strong> I see no problem with the use of the word   <strong>much</strong>. The word <strong>different</strong> is an adjective, describing <strong>place</strong>
          , a noun. The word much, an adverb modifies <strong>different</strong>, an adjective. Each of the parts of speech is in its proper place.

          <br>

          The phrase <strong>much different</strong> may look or sound strange to some readers, although it is grammatically correct. Much is an adverb and has been
          since the thirteenth century when it came to being. Therefore, <strong>much</strong> can describe <strong>different</strong>.
          If your ears still resist, try <strong>very different</strong> or <strong>extremely different</strong>. Both <strong>very </strong>
          and <strong>extremely</strong> are also verbs, capable of modifying an adjective such as <strong>different</strong>.
        </div><hr>

        <div class="mt-4">
          <h5>ANOTHER ADVERB QUESTION</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> "Is <strong>intresting enough</strong> or <strong>interestingly enough</strong> correct? " asked one caller.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ans.</strong> Either one will work, depending on how you use the words. Many people use the phrase <strong>interestingly enough</strong>
            as an introductory expression. In this context, <strong>enough</strong> is an adverb modifies another adverb, <strong>interestingly</strong>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>interestingly enough</strong>, the burglars were never caught.</p>

          <p>We can also use the phrase <strong>intersting enough</strong> in a grammatically correct sentence.</p>

          <p>The book was <strong>interesting enough </strong> to attract the attention of the censor.</p>

          <p>In this context, <storng>interesting</storng> is an adjective modified by the adverb <strong>enoughs</strong></p>
        </div><hr>

        <div class="mt-5">
          <h5>YET ANOTHER ADVERB QUESTION</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> One caller heard a radio personality say, "It look twenty years to evolve this highly." He asked, "Has the announcer used <strong>highly</strong> in the right way? I think he has, but I need some validation."

            <p>
              <strong>Ans.</strong> The radio personality did use <strong>highly</strong>, an adverb, in the correct way. It
              describes the infinitive <strong>to evolve</strong>. Since infinitives are forms of verbs, they can modified by adverbs.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, the sentence falls short of squeakely clean. The adverb <strong>highly</strong> is modified by the demonstrative
              pronoun <strong>this</strong>. Grammar allows us to use pronouns to modify noun or other pronouns. An advreb requires an adverb modifier. Let's change <strong>this</strong> to <strong>so</strong>
              . The announcer could have said, "It took twenty years to evolve so highly."
            </p>

          </p>
        </div><hr>

        <div class="mt-5">
          <h5>CREATING ADVERB</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong>"Do I just add <strong>-ly</strong> to an adjective to change it into an adverb?" asked an inquiring seventh-grader.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Ans.</strong>The adverbs we know the best are those ending in <strong>-ly</strong>, and, most of these are based on adjectives. We add <strong>-ly</strong>
            to these adjective and the result is an adverb (adjective + <strong>-ly</strong> --> adverb).
            Note that for those adjectives ending in y, changes the <strong>y</strong> to <strong>i</strong> before adding <strong>-ly.</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>angry ---> angrily</li>
            <li>awkward ---> awkwardly</li>
            <li>careful ---> carefully</li>
            <li>crazy --->crazily</li>
            <li>fanciful --> fancifully</li>
            <li>final ---> finally</li>
            <li>fond ---> fondly</li>
            <li>greedy ---> greedily</li>
            <li>indigent --> indigently</li>
            <li>mafnificient --> amgnificiently</li>
            <li>numb --> numbly</li>
            <li>petulant --> petulantly</li>
            <li>strange --> strangely</li>
            <li>sure --> surely</li>
            <li>thoughtful --> thoughtfully</li>
            <li>truthful --> truthfully</li>
            <li>wise --> wisely</li>
          </ol>

          However, not every adjective has an adverb counterpart. There is no word <strong>bigly</strong> based on <strong>big</strong>
          and no word <strong>tinily</strong> based on <strong>tiny</strong>, but there is <strong>sillily</strong> based on <strong>silly</strong>.

          <br><br>Do watch out for adverbs that do not end in <strong>-ly</strong> at all. They are their own words without origins in the world
          of adjectives. Here are a few examples: again, now, then, too, very, away, quite, seldom. This list is by no means complete, and,
          if ever in doubt, you should consult your dictionary. It is the definitive source for identifying parts of speech.

        </div><hr>

        <div class="">
          <h5>ADJECTIVES ENDING IN -LY</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> The same young man called back the next day and aasked, "What about lovely?
            That's an adjective, isn't it?"
            <br><br>
            <strong>Ans.</strong> This fellow had made another excellent point.The wary grammarian must never let his or her guard down. There are several adjectives that end in <strong>-ly</strong>
            : homely, lonely, manly, womanly. These are adjectives and adjectives only. Please note that this list is not complete.

        <div class="">
          <h5>ADJECTIVE OR ADVERB?</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>Q.</strong> A teacher at a portland elementary school asked, "Is early an adjective or an adverb?"
            <br><br>
            <strong>Ans.</strong> You must be careful with the modifier <strong>early</strong>. It is both an adjective and an adverb.
            Here are few more words that can be either adjectives or adverbs: cowardly, deep, early, friendly, hard, kindly, leisurely,
            lively, long, loud, only, and timely.
            <br> <br><br>
            We stopped at Bob's Pancake House for an <strong>early</strong> lunch. (adjective) <br>
            We rose <strong>early</strong> (adverb) <br>
            The band played a <strong>lively</strong> tune. (adjective) <br>
            Step <strong>lively</strong>, soldiers! (adverb)

        <div class="">
          <h5>HARD VS. HARDLY</h5>

          <p>
            <Strong>Q.</Strong> An English major at a colorado asked, "What is the difference between the words <strong>hard</strong>
            and <strong>hardly</strong>?" <br> <br>

            <strong>Ans.</strong> The caller was wondering about the difference between the adverbs <strong>hard</strong>
            and <strong>hardly.</strong> Remember that <strong>hard</strong> can aslo be an adjective. It is easy to think
            that <strong>hardly</strong>, the adverb from the adjective hard, retains the implication of rigidity or diligence
            of the adjective.

            <br><br>In fact, the definitions of the two words in question are quite different. As an adverb, <strong>hard</strong>
            means "firmly or diligently."<br><br>

            The novice skier fell <strong> hard</strong>.
            Jennifer thought <strong>hard</strong> on the matter. <br><br>

            The adverb <strong>hardly</strong> usualy means "barely or scarcely."<br>
            I <strong>hardly</strong> know her. <br>
            The mirror was <strong>hardly</strong> scratched.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Hardly</strong> can be used to mean "firmly or diligently," but the usage is rare. For this purpose, we often use the shorter version, <strong>hard.</strong>
          </p>
        </div><hr>

        <div class="">
          <h5>CATEGORIES OF ADVERBS</h5>

          <p>
            According to what meanings they convey, adverbs can fall into one of a number of general categories. Please note
            that the word lists follow each category title are only partial ones. <br> <br>
            <strong>Time:</strong> again, early, never, now, often, soon, then, today, tomorrow. <br>
            The plane landed five minutes <strong>early</strong>.
            <br>Our ship will come in <strong>soon.</strong><br> <br>

            <strong>Location or direction:</strong> above, away, below, down, here, in, inside, out, there, up <br>
            The sounds intensity rose <strong>above</strong> my threshold of apin. <br>
            We plan to stop <strong>here </strong> for the night.  <br><br>

            <strong>Manner: </strong> Cheerfully, cunningly, fast, quickly, right, slowly, well <br>
            The tortoise moves <strong>slowly</strong>. <br>
            The fox hunts <strong>cunningly</strong> <br><br>

            <strong>Degree: </strong> almost, entirely, little, much, rather, too, every <br>
            I am <strong>almost</strong> certain that she will be there. <br>
            There are too many bagel shops in my neighbourhood. <br><br>

            <strong>Reaosn: </strong> so, why <br>
            I don't think <strong>so.</strong> <br>
            <strong>Why</strong> did she say that? <br><br>

            <strong>Number: </strong>first, once, second, twice, third, thrice <br>
            We were here <strong>first</strong>.
            I will only say this <strong>once.</strong>

          <h5>LOT</h5>

          <p>
            <strong> Q. </strong> A travel agent asked, "What kind of wordis <strong>lot?</strong> Someone asked me, 'Are a lot more Californians
            travelling this year?' It got me thinking, and I wanted to find out." <br><br>

            <strong>Ans. </strong> <strong>Lot</strong> is usually a noun, meaning "a large amount," "One's for tune,"
            or "a share." <br><br>

            My uncle has a <strong>lot</strong> of money. <br>
            Accept your <strong>lot</strong> in life. <br>
            I  inherited the <strong>lot</strong> on the corner <br><br>

            <strong>Lot</strong> can be used as an adverb in sentences such as the one our travel agent offered. There, it means "very many." In her
            sentence, the adjective <strong>more</strong> modifies the noun <strong>Californians.</strong> The adverb <strong>lot</strong> modifies <strong>more</strong>.

          <h3 class="text-uppercase">Degree of comparision </h3>

          <p>
            Like adjectives, adverbs are simple bunch. They do not trouble us with gender, number, person, or case issues.
            These properties do not command confusing from changes in adverbs. <br>
            Adverb do change with comparisio. Like adjectives, they have three forms of compariosins: <strong>positive, comparitive, and superlative</strong>.
            The functions and characteristics of each category are the same as they were for the adjectives. The positive degree expresses the quality without comparision.
            The comparative degree compare two verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. The suparlative degree comapre three or more verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Adjectives and adverbs are compared by the same methods.
            The forms of comparision for adverbs can be created by using a suffix or an adverb.
          </p>

          <h5>ADVERB COMPARISION</h5>
          <p>
            Most adverbs are compared by using another adverb. Use <strong>more</strong> or <strong>less</strong> for the comparative forms and <strong>most</strong>
            or <strong>least</strong> for the suparlative forms. <br> <br>

            <h5>SUFFIX COMPARISION</h5>

            <p>
              There are a few adverbs that are compared by using a suffix. Use <strong> -er</strong> for the comparative forms and
              <strong>-est</strong> for the suparlative forms. These appear identical to their adjective counterparts, but, as adverbs, They
              are different in function.
