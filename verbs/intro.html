        <p>
          <strong>Verbs</strong> are words which express action, existence, or condition.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
          <p>
            Verbs are the life of language. Because of them, our words take action and we are able to express who we are and how we feel.
            Without verbs, speech and writing would be reduced to trivial naming and static description. Verbs are beyond compare. <br><br>

            Some verbs express <strong>action:</strong> <br><br>
            We <strong>danced</strong> till three in the morning. <br>
            The rock band <strong>appreciated</strong> its drummer's unshakable sense of time. <br><br>

            Other verbs indicate a <strong>condition.</strong> <br>
            Bobby <strong>is</strong> miserable after losing his dog. <br>
            This new car <strong>looks</strong> beautiful. <br><br>

            Still others speak of the <strong>existence</strong> of some person or thing. <br>
            Some of the buried workers <strong>are</strong> still alive. <br>
            This old car <strong>is</strong> on its last legs.
          </p>
      </div><hr>


      <div>
          <h3>ACTION VERBS AND LINKING VERBS</h3>
          <p>
            We can divide verbs into two general categories: <strong>action verbs</strong> and <strong>linking verbs.</strong>
            The action verb, as its name suggests, expresses action. <br><br>

            The boy <strong>ran</strong> home from school. <br>
            The lemmings <strong>leapt</strong> into the sea.ss <br><br>

            The words <strong>ran</strong> and <strong>leapt</strong> both expresses an action that some person or things takes. <br><br>

            The linking verb, sometimes known as a copulative verb, joins the subject of the sentence to some other words or words in the predicate.
            Perhaps most common linking verb is <strong>be</strong>. <br><br>

            I <strong>am</strong> happy. <br><br>

            The word <strong>am</strong>, a form of the verb <strong>be</strong>, links the subject <strong>I</strong> to the subject complement <strong>happy</strong>.
            It indicates the subject's condition or existence. <br><br>

            A few verbs cab be either action or linking verbs, depending on how they are used: feel, grow, keep, look, prove, remain, smell, sound,
            stay, taste. If these verbs serve a linking purpose, they are linking verbs. If they express action, they are action verbs. <br><br>

            ACTION - We <strong>taste</strong> the fine wines. <br>
            LINKING - The wine <strong>tastes</strong> fine. <br>

            ACTION - We <strong>stay</strong> in the penthouse suite. <br>
            LINKING - The crowd <strong>stays</strong> silent. <br>

            ACTION - I <strong>feel</strong> some pain from the injury. <br>
            LINKING - The comforter <strong>feels</strong> soft. <br><br>

            If you are unsure, substitute the appropriate form of the verb <strong>be.</strong> Does it fit? If the answer is "yes," the verb is a
            linking verb.

          </p>

        <h3>VERB PHRASES</h3>
        <p>
          Verb phrases are composed of more than one verb. <br>
          The mayor <strong>has remainded</strong> in office for three consecutive terms. <br><br>
          In this senetence, <strong>has remainded</strong> is a verb phraes because it is composed of two verbs. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h5>PRINCIPAL OR MAIN VERB</h5>

        <p>
          In a verb phrase, the <strong>principal verb,</strong> known as <strong>main verb</strong> in modern grammar, is the meat of the phrase.
          By itself, it can express complete action, existence, or condition. In the verb phrase mentioned previously, <strong>remained</strong> is the
          principal or main verb. It tells us what action the mayor has taken. The principal or main verb is always positioned at the end of the verb phrase. <br>

        </p><br>

        <h5>AUXILIARY VERB</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Auxiliary</strong> or <strong>helping verbs</strong> are the verbs in the verb phrase that precede the principal or main verb.
          A verb phrase may contain as many as four auxiliary verbs. These verbs can specify characteristics of the principal or main verb but cannot
          stand alone as complete verb. The verb <strong>has</strong> is an Auxiliary verb in the example given above. Other auxiliary verbs
          <strong>be, have, do, can, may, will, shall, and must</strong>. <br><br>

          In a verb phrase, it is the first auxiliary verb that indicates the tense of the phrase. <br><br>

          I <strong>was</strong> shopping for a new pair of shoes. <br>
          John <strong>is</strong> boarding the plane as we speak. <br>
          I <strong>will</strong> arrive shortly. <br><br>

          In the first example, the auxiliary verb <strong>was</strong> in the verb phrase <strong>was shopping</strong> tells us that the
          phrase is in the past tense. In the second example, the auxiliary verb <strong>is</strong> in the verb phrase <strong>is boarding</strong>
          indicates that the phrase is in the present tense. In the third example, the auxiliary verb will in the verb phrase <strong>will arrive</strong>
          indicates that the phrase is in the future tense. <br>
        </p><br>

        <h5>FROM MY FILES: READING AND WRITING CAREFULLY</h5>

        <p>
          Many years ago, I wrote to president Gamel Abdel Nasser, former president of Egypt, asking him to share his wisdom and overwhelming optimism with my
          junior high school students. To my delight, he responded. Of great interest to me was the postscript to his letter. It read,
          "Michael, what do you think about my sentenec structure? I read the New York Times every day." <br><br>

          President Nasser's writing was impeccable. I picked up my copy of Times and scanned the syntax of several articles. They were identical in structure to those
          of President Nasser's. Here was another invaluable, albeit unintentional, lesson from a great man: the person who reads is a person who writes, and the
          individual who reads carefully is one who writes carefully.

      <div class="">
        <h3 class="text-uppercase">characteristics of verbs</h3>

        <p>
          Verbs are associated with five primary characteristics: <strong>number, person, voice, mood and tense</strong>. These determine what form
          a verb takes and how it is used in a sentence. We will look at each characteristic in turn.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5>NUMBERS</h5>
        <p>
          The numbers of the verb indicates how many people, creatures, or things a verb refers to. Number comes in just two flavors: <strong>singular and plural</strong>
          . A singular verb refers to only one person or thing, while a plural verb may refer to many.
          <br><br>

                <td>We <strong>swim</strong>.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </p><br>

        <h5>Person</h5>

        <p>
          We use the category of person to describe the perspective from which the speaker makes his or her statements or observations.
          Is he or she the person speaking or spoken to, or is he or she the person or object spoken of? There are three different persons or perspective
          that the verb can take: <strong>first person, second person, and third person.</strong> <br>
        </p><br>

        <h6>FIRST PERSON</h6>
        <p>
          In the <strong>first person</strong>, the speaker includes himself or herself as one who takes the action or whose condition is described.
          This person is appropriate to situation where the speaker wants to describe what he or she doing, seeing, or feeling. The first
          person employs the pronouns <strong>I and we</strong>, and the first person verbs take the forms appropriate to these pronouns. <br><br>

          I <strong>laugh</strong> at danger. <br>
          We <strong>were</strong> not pleased.
        </p><br>

        <h6>SECOND PERSON</h6>

        <p>
          In the <strong>second person</strong>, the speaker addresses the person or people around him or her. This category of person employs
          the pronouns <strong>you</strong>, both the singular form (you, the individual) and the plural form (you, a group).
          Again, the second person verbs must take forms appropriate to these pronouns. <br><br>

          You <strong>are</strong> not <strong>going</strong> to be happy when your father gets home. <br>
          All of you <strong>drove</strong> here from Phoenix in that city car? <br>
        </p><br>

        <h6>THIRD PERSON</h6>
        <p>
          To speak in the <strong>third person</strong> is to speak or write about those around you. The third person perspective might be that of a normal
          human observing his or her environment. It could also be that of an omniscient observer, looking at the world from on high, able to see and hear
          everything that is going on. The third person employs the pronouns <strong>he, she,it, and they</strong> or any third person noun.
          The third person verbs must take forms appropriate to these pronouns or nouns. <br><br>

          she <strong>thinks</strong> of him fondly. <br>
          They <strong>caught</strong> the last train to clarksville. <br>
          My old car <strong>may be</strong> ugly, but it runs well. <br><br>


        </p> <br>

        <h5>VOICE</h5>
        <p>
          The voice of a verb indicates the strength of the subject in a sentence. It tells us whether that subject takes action or recives action.
          There are two possible voices: <strong>active and passive</strong>. In the active voice, the stronger form, the subject of the sentence takes the action of the verb. <br><br>

          Our army <strong>won</strong> the battle.

          The subject <strong>army</strong> is strong since it takes action. This sentence uses the active voice. In the passive voice, the weaker form, the subject is acted upon. <br><br>

          The batthle <strong>was won</strong> by our army. <br><br>

          In this senetence, the subject <strong>battle </strong> is weak because it receives the action of the army. It takes no action of its own __ a battle cannot win itself __ and so the sentence uses
          the passive voice. <br>
          Computer grammar checkers put a great emphasis on flagging and discouraging the passive voice. The passive voice, according to these programs, is unnecessary in most cases
          and can weaken your content. It is wordier than the active voice because it requires a verb phase, vaguer than the active voice,
          and, at its worst, deliberately descriptive. However, some fields, notably the sciences, require the passive voice for description of a process. you and your
          grammar checker should choose the voice appropriate for your audience. <br><br>

          But why depend upon grammar checkers when it is easy to spot the difference between active and passive voices on your own? The best way to find
          the passive voice is to look for the preposition <strong>by</strong>. The action verbs in the passive voice is usually done by one party to another.
          <br><br> The party given <strong>by</strong> my best friend. <br><br>
          If the word <strong>by</strong> isn't present, is it possibe to insert a phrase beginning with the word <strong>by</strong>
          that indicates who performed the action? <br> <br>
          The boxing match was thrown. <br>
          or The match was thrown <strong>by</strong> the crooked fighter. <br><br>
          If you can, you have found a senetence in the passive voice.
        </p><br>

        <h6>PASSIVE LESSONS</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>A supervisor at Pacific Gas & Electric asked about a sentence
          he had written. He said, " 'It fell to me to write the report.'Is that correct sentence?" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans.</strong>
          In general, grammarians prefer the active over the passive
          voice. It is usually better to speak of action taken than of action
           received. The supervisor's statement was in the passive voice.
          The "falling" of the report was received by him, the supervisor
          Before we pass judgment on this man's grammar, however, we
          must acknowledge that the passive voice exists for a reason. One
          cannot always express an idea deftly in the active voice, and, in
          such situations, the passive voice is entirely appropriate. The supervisor
          has written that he was the only person with the ability or
          inclination to write the report. Any attempt to alter the verb to the
          active voice will result in a less concise sentence or in a sentence
          with a different meaning. The supervisor has used the grammar
          that his situation demands.
        </p><br>

        <h6>ANOTHER VOICE LESSON</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>
          A teacher of report writing at a police academy needed to know if his senetence was correct. It read, "What you need is not mentioned in any
          of the pamphlets that are requested." <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          Please change the passive voice to the active. "None of the
          pamphlets mentions what you need."
        </p><br>

        <h5>MOOD</h5>
        <p>
          In grammar the mood of a verb does not describe its emotional state -- as if a verb, a word, could feel joy or rage. Instead, mood is a form of the verb
          that indicates speaker's attitude toward his or her use of that verb. Like an emotion, a grammatical mood is a state of mind. To be more precise
          , it is the speaker's mental conception of the verb he or she is using. And, as opposed to the hundreds of emotions we can feel, there are just
          three grammatical moods: <strong>indicative, imperative, subjunctive.</strong>
        </p><br>
        <h6>INDICATIVE MOOD</h6>
        <p>
          To use the indicative mood is to make a statement or ask a question. It is the most commonly used of the three moods. Take a look at some
          example that contain verbs in the indicative mood. <br><br>
          The pavement <strong>shimmered</strong> in the hot afternoon sun. <br>
          <strong>Did</strong> you <strong>see</strong> that light in the sky? <br><br>

          In the first example, the verb <strong>shimmered</strong>indicates what the pavement did. Here, the speaker is stating the fact that "the pavement shimmered."
          The indicative mood always involves statements, questions, or exclamatory sentences.
          In the second example, the verb phrase <strong>did see</strong>, broken by the
          pronoun <strong>you</strong> since the sentence is in the form of a question, in
          cates what was seen in the sky. This sentence questions a fact.

        </p><br>

        <h6>IMPERATIVE MOOD</h6>
        <p>
          Verbs in the imperative mood give command or make requests. Any time someone is told or asked to do something, the verb used is in the imperative mood. <br><br>
          <strong>Wipe</strong> that grin off your face! <br>
          <strong>Set</strong> the VCR to begin recording  9:30 <br>
          Please <strong>fetch</strong> me my slippers <br><br>
          The first two examples are commands. The final example is a re-
          quest. The verbs wipe, set, and fetch are all in the imperative
          mood. <br>
          Verbs in the imperative mood are, by necessity, in the second
          person. A request or command is always spoken directly to another
          person or other persons. The second person pronoun <strong>you</strong> is often
          left out but can be put back if the speaker so desires.

        </p><br>
        <h6 class="text-uppercase">Subjunctive Mood </h6>
        <p>
          Subjunctive mood verbs express wishes or make statements
          contrary to fact. They express hypothetical or imaginary situations. <br><br>
          I wish I <strong>were</strong> with you. <br>
          If I <strong>had been</strong> there, none of this would have happened. <br>
          If we <strong>lived</strong> in San Francisco, we'd be much happier. <br>
          Unless we <strong>go</strong> now, we'll be late. <br><br>

          The conjunction <strong>if</strong> is frequently used with the subjunctive mood
          but the conjunctions <strong>though, lest, unless, that, and till may be
          used as well</strong>. <br><br>
          <strong>If</strong> I were thinner, I'd eat more chocolate. <br><br>
          The verb <strong>were</strong> is in the subjunctive mood. It expresses a condition
          contrary to fact. Sadly, I am not as thin as I would like to be, so I
          must limit my chocolate consumption. <br>
          These constructions normally come in two parts. One starts
          with a conjunction, such as <strong>if</strong>: if I were thinner. This part contains
          the subjunctive verb and is called a subordinate clause. It has a subject and a predicate but cannot stand alone
          and make sense. The other shows the result of the hypothetical situation:
          I'd eat more chocolate. This part can stand alone. <br><br>

          As mentioned before, the subjunctive mood can also express a
          wish. I wish that I <strong>were</strong> in the Bahamas. Oh, that I only were. In
          spite of some very realistic day-dreaming, my body still resides in
          Southern California. <br><br>
          The subjunctive mood is also used to make commands. <br>
          It is necessary that he <strong>be told</strong> immediately <br><br>
          The verb phrase <strong>be told</strong> is in the subjunctive mood. It is part of a
          subordinate clause beginning with the conjunction <strong>that</strong>. <br><br>

          Other verbs are put in the subjunctive mood to express a parlia-
          mentary motion
          I move that Mr. Bugle be permitted to keep chickens in his
          yard
          Be permitted is a subjunctive verb, part of a subordinate clause be-
          ginning with the conjunction that.
        </p> <br>
        <h6>A SUBJUNCTIVE QUESTION</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>
           A Frenchman living in the United States asked if these sentences
           expressed the same idea. "I'm not sure which one say
          what I really mean: 'I wish I were there' or 'I wish that I had been
          there.'" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans.</strong>
          The meanings of the sentences are similar but not identical.
          . The difference involves the forms of the verbs. Both sen-
          tences are perfect grammatically. They express wishes, so their
          verbs are in the subjunctive mood, the mood of choice when verbs
          express conditions contrary to fact. They differ as to when the wish
          could come true. Using the first, the Frenchman would wish that he
          were present at some event in the present. <br><br>
          I wish I were with you now. <br><br>
          Using the second, he would wish that he had been present at some
          event already concluded. <br><br>
          I wish that I had been there three days ago. <br><br>
          The meanings are similar. The time frames are different.
        </p><br><br>

        <h5>TENSE</h5>

        <p>
          Every verb has a place in time. The action or state of being may
          be immediate, in the here and now. It may have happened so
          time ago. Or it may not have happened yet. We talk of the placment
          of a verb in time, its tense, as being in the <strong>past, present, or
          future</strong>.
        </p>
          <h6>PRESENT TENSE</h6>
        <p>
            In the present, you are reading this very sentence. The verb
            phrase are reading is in the present tense. The present tense in-
            cludes only those actions or states of being that exist in the
            immediate moment. Perhaps you are also considering a trip to the
            kitchen, thinking, "I am hungry." The verb <strong>am</strong> is in the present
            tense.
        </p><br>

        <h6>PAST TENSE</h6>
        </p>
          In the not too distant past, you read a sentence that starts several
           lines above this one. The verb <strong>read</strong>, pronounced with a short <strong>e</strong>, is
          in the past tense. In the more distant past, you wisely purchased
          this book from the local bookstore. The verb <strong>purchased</strong> is also in
          the past tense. The past tense includes any action or state of being
          that we could find between the dawn of time and a split second before
           the present.
        </p><br>

        <h6>FUTURE TENSE</h6>
        <p>
          In the near future, you will finish this page. The verb phrase
          <strong>will finish</strong> is in the future tense. In the more distant future you will
          finish this book and will recommend it to all of your friends. The
          verb phrases <strong>will finish</strong> and <strong>will recommend</strong> are also in the future
          tense. The future tense encompasses all actions or states of being
          we might encounter between the briefest of moments after the
          present and the end of time. <br>
          A verb in the future tense is, by necessity, in the form of a verb
          phrase. Because there are no future tense forms for single verbs
          grammar demands that we use one of the auxiliaries <strong>shall or will</strong>
          with a principal or main verb in a verb phrase to create the future
          tense. <br><br>
          Our armies <strong>will vanquish</strong> our enemies.
          I <strong>shall return</strong>
          The verb phrases <strong>will vanquish</strong> and <strong>shall return</strong> are both in the fu-
          ture tense.

        <h6>MATTER OF STYLE</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>A deejay asked if the sentence "James Taylor still got his
          friends" was correct. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          <strong>Got</strong> is the past tense of get. If James got his friends, then he
          acquired them in the past. Whoever made that statement
          meant to say that James Taylor still retains his friends. He should
          have said, "James Taylor still has his friends."
          Of course, the deejay was playing off the song You ve Gota
          Friend. Most critics and listeners believe that the grammatically incorrect
          version may be a better choice of style. The power of music
          is due to the personal connection it makes with listeners. Music
          that speaks to us speaks a common language, a language that does
          not always respect the conventions of grammar. While song writers
          do not need to show a blanket disregard for these conventions
          they may write around them with poetic license.

        <h6>WHICH TENSE?</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>"Does this sentence need a present or past tense verb?"
          asked an attorney. "She, the deceased, is/was a cousin of
          Mrs. Jones." <br><br>
          <strong>Ans.</strong>
          <strong>Was</strong> is correct because the deceased no longer exists on the
           material plane. If the words were reversed, "Mrs. Jones,
          among the living, is a cousin of the deceased," then <strong>is</strong> would be
          correct because Mrs. Jones is still here
        </p><br>

        <h6>PAST TENSE VERBS IN THE PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>"Do all past tense verbs have to take place in the past?" an
          e editorial advisor asked. Her question caused the Hot Line to
          do some serious thinking. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans.</strong>
          The answer wasn't as obvious as it first seemed. By using the
          o subjunctive mood to express something that might or could
          happen but has not happened, a condition contrary to fact, the action,
          , expressed by the past tense verb, could take place in the past, present, or future. <br><br>
          If I <strong>lost</strong> it all tomorrow, I simply would not care. <br><br>
          Lost is in the past tense, but its action occurs in the future. This was
          a bright question from a very intelligent caller.
        </p><br>

        <h6>SIMPLE, PERFECT, AND PROGRESSIVE FORMS OF VERBS</h6>
        <p>
        In the discussion of tenses above, we talked about the three tenses in their most basic forms, the <strong>simple forms</strong>. In their simple
        forms, the three tenses involve actions that merely occur at their respective places in time. Unless otherwise specified, we assume a
        tense to be simple. When we refer to the present tense, we are referring to the simple present. When we refer to the past tense, we
        are referring to the simple past. And when we refer to the future tense, we are referring to the simple future. <br><br>
        Sometimes, however, it becomes necessary to use the verb to imply action that ends. Here, we need to use the perfect forms. The
        perfect forms of the past, present, and future tenses have fixed ending points in terms of time. <br><br>
        In its perfect form (called the <strong>present perfect</strong>), the present tense
        expresses action or condition that is completed in the present. To
        form the present perfect tense of a verb, use <strong>have or has</strong> with the
        past participle of the main verb (<strong>have</strong> or </strong><strong>has</strong> + verb+ -ed). <br><br>
        I <strong>have completed</strong> my work. <br><br>
        The work is complete now, in the present. The verb phrase have
        completed is in the present perfect tense.
        In the perfect form of the past tense (called the past perfect),
        the verb expresses action or condition that was completed before a
        certain time in the past. To form the past perfect tense of a verb, use
        had with the past participle of the main verb (had + verb + -ed)
        I had completed my work.
        Here, the work was complete at some point in the past. The verb
        phrase had completed is in the past perfect iense.
        In the perfect form of the future tense (called the future per-
        fect), the verb relates action that will be completed before a certain
        time in the future. To form the future perfect tense of a verb, use ei-

        <h3>CONJUGATION</h3>
        <p>
          The conjugation of a verb is the complete set of verb forms inflected across tense, mood, voice, person, and number. Since a complete conjugation table showing
          every possible form of a verb would be quite unwieldy, we often limit our conjugation to the <strong>principal parts</strong> of verbs: <strong>present indicative, past indicative, and past participle</strong>
          . Knowing these three forms alone, we can discern the rest.
