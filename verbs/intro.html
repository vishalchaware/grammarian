        <p>
          <strong>Verbs</strong> are words which express action, existence, or condition.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
          <p>
            Verbs are the life of language. Because of them, our words take action and we are able to express who we are and how we feel.
            Without verbs, speech and writing would be reduced to trivial naming and static description. Verbs are beyond compare. <br><br>

            Some verbs express <strong>action:</strong> <br><br>
            We <strong>danced</strong> till three in the morning. <br>
            The rock band <strong>appreciated</strong> its drummer's unshakable sense of time. <br><br>

            Other verbs indicate a <strong>condition.</strong> <br>
            Bobby <strong>is</strong> miserable after losing his dog. <br>
            This new car <strong>looks</strong> beautiful. <br><br>

            Still others speak of the <strong>existence</strong> of some person or thing. <br>
            Some of the buried workers <strong>are</strong> still alive. <br>
            This old car <strong>is</strong> on its last legs.
          </p>

          <h3>ACTION VERBS AND LINKING VERBS</h3>
          <p>
            We can divide verbs into two general categories: <strong>action verbs</strong> and <strong>linking verbs.</strong>
            The action verb, as its name suggests, expresses action. <br><br>

            The boy <strong>ran</strong> home from school. <br>
            The lemmings <strong>leapt</strong> into the sea.ss <br><br>

            The words <strong>ran</strong> and <strong>leapt</strong> both expresses an action that some person or things takes. <br><br>

            The linking verb, sometimes known as a copulative verb, joins the subject of the sentence to some other words or words in the predicate.
            Perhaps most common linking verb is <strong>be</strong>. <br><br>

            I <strong>am</strong> happy. <br><br>

            The word <strong>am</strong>, a form of the verb <strong>be</strong>, links the subject <strong>I</strong> to the subject complement <strong>happy</strong>.
            It indicates the subject's condition or existence. <br><br>

            A few verbs cab be either action or linking verbs, depending on how they are used: feel, grow, keep, look, prove, remain, smell, sound,
            stay, taste. If these verbs serve a linking purpose, they are linking verbs. If they express action, they are action verbs. <br><br>

            ACTION - We <strong>taste</strong> the fine wines. <br>
            LINKING - The wine <strong>tastes</strong> fine. <br>

            ACTION - We <strong>stay</strong> in the penthouse suite. <br>
            LINKING - The crowd <strong>stays</strong> silent. <br>

            ACTION - I <strong>feel</strong> some pain from the injury. <br>
            LINKING - The comforter <strong>feels</strong> soft. <br><br>

            If you are unsure, substitute the appropriate form of the verb <strong>be.</strong> Does it fit? If the answer is "yes," the verb is a
            linking verb.

        <h3>VERB PHRASES</h3>
        <p>
          Verb phrases are composed of more than one verb. <br>
          The mayor <strong>has remainded</strong> in office for three consecutive terms. <br><br>
          In this senetence, <strong>has remainded</strong> is a verb phraes because it is composed of two verbs. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h5>PRINCIPAL OR MAIN VERB</h5>

        <p>
          In a verb phrase, the <strong>principal verb,</strong> known as <strong>main verb</strong> in modern grammar, is the meat of the phrase.
          By itself, it can express complete action, existence, or condition. In the verb phrase mentioned previously, <strong>remained</strong> is the
          principal or main verb. It tells us what action the mayor has taken. The principal or main verb is always positioned at the end of the verb phrase. <br>

        </p><br>

        <h5>AUXILIARY VERB</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Auxiliary</strong> or <strong>helping verbs</strong> are the verbs in the verb phrase that precede the principal or main verb.
          A verb phrase may contain as many as four auxiliary verbs. These verbs can specify characteristics of the principal or main verb but cannot
          stand alone as complete verb. The verb <strong>has</strong> is an Auxiliary verb in the example given above. Other auxiliary verbs
          <strong>be, have, do, can, may, will, shall, and must</strong>. <br><br>

          In a verb phrase, it is the first auxiliary verb that indicates the tense of the phrase. <br><br>

          I <strong>was</strong> shopping for a new pair of shoes. <br>
          John <strong>is</strong> boarding the plane as we speak. <br>
          I <strong>will</strong> arrive shortly. <br><br>

          In the first example, the auxiliary verb <strong>was</strong> in the verb phrase <strong>was shopping</strong> tells us that the
          phrase is in the past tense. In the second example, the auxiliary verb <strong>is</strong> in the verb phrase <strong>is boarding</strong>
          indicates that the phrase is in the present tense. In the third example, the auxiliary verb will in the verb phrase <strong>will arrive</strong>
          indicates that the phrase is in the future tense. <br>
        </p><br>

        <h5>FROM MY FILES: READING AND WRITING CAREFULLY</h5>

        <p>
          Many years ago, I wrote to president Gamel Abdel Nasser, former president of Egypt, asking him to share his wisdom and overwhelming optimism with my
          junior high school students. To my delight, he responded. Of great interest to me was the postscript to his letter. It read,
          "Michael, what do you think about my sentenec structure? I read the New York Times every day." <br><br>

          President Nasser's writing was impeccable. I picked up my copy of Times and scanned the syntax of several articles. They were identical in structure to those
          of President Nasser's. Here was another invaluable, albeit unintentional, lesson from a great man: the person who reads is a person who writes, and the
          individual who reads carefully is one who writes carefully.

        <h3 class="text-uppercase">characteristics of verbs</h3>

        <p>
          Verbs are associated with five primary characteristics: <strong>number, person, voice, mood and tense</strong>. These determine what form
          a verb takes and how it is used in a sentence. We will look at each characteristic in turn.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5>NUMBERS</h5>
        <p>
          The numbers of the verb indicates how many people, creatures, or things a verb refers to. Number comes in just two flavors: <strong>singular and plural</strong>
          . A singular verb refers to only one person or thing, while a plural verb may refer to many.

              <tr>
                <th scope="col">SINGULAR</th>
                <th scope="col">PLURAL</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>He <strong>runs</strong>.</td>
                <td>They <strong>run</strong>.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>She <strong>is</strong> winning.</td>
                <td>They <strong>are</strong> winning.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>I <strong>swim</strong>.</td>
                <td>We <strong>swim</strong>.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </p><br>

        <h5>Person</h5>

        <p>
          We use the category of person to describe the perspective from which the speaker makes his or her statements or observations.
          Is he or she the person speaking or spoken to, or is he or she the person or object spoken of? There are three different persons or perspective
          that the verb can take: <strong>first person, second person, and third person.</strong> <br>
        </p><br>

        <h6>FIRST PERSON</h6>
        <p>
          In the <strong>first person</strong>, the speaker includes himself or herself as one who takes the action or whose condition is described.
          This person is appropriate to situation where the speaker wants to describe what he or she doing, seeing, or feeling. The first
          person employs the pronouns <strong>I and we</strong>, and the first person verbs take the forms appropriate to these pronouns. <br><br>

          I <strong>laugh</strong> at danger. <br>
          We <strong>were</strong> not pleased.
        </p><br>

        <h6>SECOND PERSON</h6>

        <p>
          In the <strong>second person</strong>, the speaker addresses the person or people around him or her. This category of person employs
          the pronouns <strong>you</strong>, both the singular form (you, the individual) and the plural form (you, a group).
          Again, the second person verbs must take forms appropriate to these pronouns. <br>

          You are not going to be happy when your father gets home. <br>
