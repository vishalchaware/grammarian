          <strong>Verbals</strong> are forms of verbs that are used as other parts of speech.

          Riddle me this, dear reader: When is a verb not a verb? The answer: When it's a verbal. The verbal is a verb form used as another part of speech. It is a powerful grammatical construct that allows us to use words derived from verbs in non-verb roles. There are three of these in English: <strong>participles, gerunds,</strong> and <strong>infinitives.</strong> <br><br>
          Because they are derived from verbs, verbals retain some of the abilities of verbs. They can carry objects or take modifiers and complements. At the same time, verbals possesses abilities unknown to the typical verb, the abilities of other parts of speech. In this way, verbals may perform the duties of two parts of speech simultneously. <br><br>
          In spite of these new powers, the verbal must give up one of the abilities of its original verb form. No verbal can assume the role of a true verb to express action or condition in a sentence.
