          <strong>Nouns</strong> are naming words. They give titles to people, places, things, and ideas.

          Imagine a world without names. Imagine, for a moment, the horror and absurdity of ordering a simple meal without naming words. "I'll take one of those things with the two soft, round things on the outside and one of those brown mushy things on the inside, and it's got some red stuff and some yellow stuff and some round, green things on it."
          Oh, you must mean a hamburger! You see, I couldn't even get through this ridiculous scenario without using a couple of generic naming words, such as <strong>stuff</strong> or
          <strong>things.</strong> What's in a name? Sometimes, a name is everything. <br><br>
          The word <strong>noun</strong> comes from the latin word <strong>nomen</strong>, meaning "name." Nouns are names of people, places, things, and ideas. Anything we can imagine has a name. If someone discovers a person, place, thing, or idea without a name, you can be sure that steps will be taken to remedy that situation. <br><br>
          Any nutritious sentence is chock full of nouns. In the examples below, each of the bold words is a noun. <br><br>
          My <strong>friend, Buddy, </strong> has a <strong>Ph.D</strong> in <strong>physics.</strong><br>
          The <strong>squirrel</strong> stole <strong>nuts</strong> from the <strong>chipmunk.</strong> <br>
          My <strong>dog</strong> watches <strong>television</strong> in the <strong>evening</strong>. <br>
          The <strong>purpose</strong> of this <strong>exam</strong> is to scare the <strong>life</strong> out of you. <br>
          The <strong>weight</strong> of <strong>gold</strong> is measured in <strong>karats.</strong>.

        <h5>A TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER A WORD IS A NOUN</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "Is there a litmus test to determine wheter a word is a noun?" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>While there is no sure-fire way to determine wheter a word is a noun in every situation,
