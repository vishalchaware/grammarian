      <h1 class="my-4 text-center">ADJECTIVES</h1>

      <div class="border p-4 my-3 h3 font-weight-normal Ubuntu text-center">
        <p>
          <strong>Adjectives</strong> are words that modify nouns or pronouns .
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <p>
          One task of language is to paint a picture. If verbs and nouns are outlines and shapes, then adjectives are colors and textures. Adjectives fall into a broad class of words called <strong>modifiers</strong>.
          A modifiers is any word that acts to describe or qualify another words in such a way that it changes the other word's meaning. Describing and qualifying nouns and pronouns are the primary function of adjectives.
          <br><br>Here is a simple example: "I watched a movie on television." This sentence is not terribly informative or inspirational because it lacks adjectives. To accurately describe
          the wonders of modern technology, we need to add some color: "I watched the <strong>greatest action </strong> movie of all time, <i>Star Wars,</i> on my <strong>new, delightally-enhanced</strong>
          television." The addition of the adjectives changes what we know of the nouns.
        </p>

      <div class="">
        <h3>TYPES OF ADJECTIVES</h3>
        <p>
          There are two main flavors of adjective: <strong>descriptive</strong> and <strong>limiting.</strong>
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase">Descriptive adjectives </h5>
        <p>
          Descriptive adjectives describe the nouns and pronouns they modify. They point out color, shape, texture, scent or any other quality that entities named by nouns and pronouns can
          possess.This is the function of the adjective with which we are the most familiar. <br><br>
          The <strong>hot</strong> pan burnt my fingers. <br>
          I'll have a <strong>tall</strong> glass of lemonade. <br>
          I am <strong>thirsty.</strong> <br><br>

          In the first example, the adjective <strong>hot</strong> describes the noun <strong>pan.</strong> In the second example, the adjective <strong>tall</strong> describes the noun <strong>glass</strong>.
          In the third example, the adjective <strong>thirsty</strong> describes the pronouns<strong> I.</strong> <br><br>
          Some of the descriptive adjectives are also <strong>proper adjectives,</strong> derived from proper nouns. Usually, the proper noun undergoes some mild changes in form on its way to becoming an adjective.
          The proper noun <strong>America</strong> changes into proper adjective <strong>American.</strong> The proper noun <strong>Orwell</strong> turns into the proper adjective <strong>Orwellian.</strong>
          <br><br><strong>America</strong> had no idea what one day would be <strong>American.</strong> <br>
          <strong>Orwell</strong> imagined a bleak, <strong>Orwellian</strong> future. <br><br>
          Proper adjectives need to be capitalized as are the proper nounsin which they have origins.
        </p> <br>
        <h6>CHOOSING THE CORRECT ADJECTIVE</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "My boyfriend said to me, 'That is heaven.' Shouldn't he have said 'That is heavenly'?" asked a young woman. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> The young lady was, indeed,correct. <strong>Heaven</strong> is a noun. It names the place in which her boyfriend found himself. <strong>Heavenly</strong>
          is an adjective. It describes the feelings her boyfriend had. He should have said, "That is heavenly."
        </p><br>
        <h6>THE NATURE OF MANIFEST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "Is <strong>manifest</strong> a verb or an adjective?" Inquired a historian who frequented the Hot Line. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> <strong>Manifest</strong> can be a verb or an adjectives. As an adjective, it means "evident or obvious." <br>
          His destiny is <strong>manifest.</strong> <br>
          We discussed the <strong>manifest</strong> content of my dream. <br><br>
          As a verb, it means "to become obvious." <br>
          Her happiness <strong>manifested</strong> itself in her smile. <br>
          His curiosity <strong>manifests</strong> itself in his question. <br><br>
          Be aware that there is another adjective, <strong>manifestable,</strong> derived from the verb. <br>
          His guilt was <strong>manifestable</strong> because of the strong evidence. <br>
          Your unconscious desires are <strong>manifestable</strong> under the therapist's tutelage.
          <br>Manifestable means "able to become obvious."
        </p> <br>
        <h5>LIMITING ADJECTIVE</h5>
        <p>
          Limiting adjectives restrict the definitions of the nouns and pronouns they modify. The demonstrative pronouns sometimes function as limiting adjectives because they point
          out certain objects from a group. <br> <strong>This</strong> dog is mine. <br><br>
          Which dog is mine? This dog is mine. Not that dog or that dog. That other dog over there isn't either. This dog here in front of me is mine. The demonstrative pronoun <strong>this</strong>
          limits the meaning of the noun <strong>dog</strong> by identifying it with a single animal. <br><br>
          Most standard limiting adjectives describe quantity. These include the numbers, <strong>one, two, three,</strong> etc., and assorted quantity such as <strong>half, double, daily,</strong> and <strong>weekly</strong>, among others. <br>
          I found <strong>five</strong> dollar in my pocket. <br>
          I read the <strong>daily</strong> paper. <br><br>
          The adjective in the first example answers the question "How many dollars did I find?" The answer is "five dollars." The adjective <strong>five</strong> limits the meaning of the noun <strong>dollars</strong>
          by telling how many were found. Because of its influence, we know the five, and not one, ten, or twenty dollars, was found. <br>
          The adjective in the second example answers the question "What kind of paper do I read?" The answer is "a daily paper." The adjective daily limits the meaning of the noun <strong>paper.</strong>
          It tells us that the paper is the daily kind, not the biweekly, monthly, or yearly kind.
        </p>
        <h6>FROM MY FILES: POLITICALLY CORRECT GRAMMAR</h6>
        <p>
          I recently heard the mayor of a major American city speak about the battle raging between grammatical and political correctness. What are the difference between words or phrases that are politically correctlyand their
          and their grammatically correct counterparts? There need not be any difference at all. Speech can be both grammatically correct and socially aware. What identifications do you
          make with each of these pairs of labels: a blind Indian vs. a visually impaired Native American, a barmaid vs. a bardender, a third-world country vs. a developing nation, ignorant vs. educationally disadvantagedd, a salesman vs. a salesperson, a
          chairman vs. a chair? The first in each pair is outdated and politically incorrect, whereas the second is sensitive,  modern, <i>and</i> grammatically correct. <br><br>
          While it is important that our words show respect, we must not let our desires not to offend carry our speech to a ridiculous extreme. Author Sue Grafton twits political correctness
          in her book. <i>L is for Lawless</i> by deliberately forming some strange constructions. She names a girl stewardperson instead of a stewardess, places a bellhuman in place
          of a bellboy, and asked that desks be "personed" insted of "manned." Whichever words you choose, be aware that they can elicit a smile or a frown.

      <div class="">
        <h3>DEGREE OF COMPARISION</h3>
        <p>
          The primary characteristic of the adjective is its lack of characteristics, its ease of use. Unlike nouns, pronouns, and verbs, which trouble us with form of changes and gender and number and
          case and person, adjectives are a very static bunch. English, unlike almost all other languages, has smartly decided that modifiers should not be affected by those troublesome properties.
          The word <strong>beautiful</strong> remains the same whether it applies to a man or a woman, a boy or a girl, a dog or a cat, a car or a painting. So it is with the rest of the adjectives. <br>
          The one characteristics that adjectives do possess is that of comparision. Many times, it is necessary to express the degree of a quality that one  object possess in relation to other objects.
          We can manipulate the form of adjective to express this relationship. There are three levels of comparision: <strong>positive, comparative, and suparlative.</strong>
        </p> <br>
        <h5>POSITIVE DEGREE</h5>
        <p>
          The positive degree, the adjective in its most basic form, indicates a lack of comparision. An adjective in the positive degree expresses the pure quality of an object without making
          a comparision with other objects. <br><br>
          The night is <strong>warm.</strong><br>
          Anna's dress is <strong>beautiful.</strong> <br>
          Her <strong>long</strong> hair shimmers in the moonlight.<br><br>
          In each examples, the adjectives names a quality of a single object without making any comparision.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>COMPARATIVE DEGREE</h5>
        <p>
          In the comparative degree, one object holds a greater or lesser degree of a quality than the object(s) with which it is compared. Often, this degree compares just two objects. <br><br>
          This house is <strong>smaller</strong> than that one. <br>
          This painting is <strong>more beautiful</strong> than that one. <br>
          The waves today are <strong>less voilent</strong> than the ones yesterday. <br><br>
          In the first example, one house possesses the quality of smallness to a greater degree than another house. In the second example, one painting possesses a greater degree of beauty than another
          painting. In the final example, one set of waves is seen a possessing a lesser degree of voilence than another set. <br>Comparision in the comparative degree is often created after
          the adjective by the conjunction <strong>than</strong>. This conjunction sets up the objects with which the main object is compared. <br>
          I think ice cream is tastier <strong>than</strong> cake. <br>
          Beth believe that movies are less enjoyable <strong>than</strong> books. <br><br>
          In the first example, <strong>than</strong> sets up a comparision between ice cream and cake. The adjective <strong>tastier</strong> modifies the noun <strong>ice cream</strong>
          Ice cream possesses the quality of tastiness to a greater degree than cake does. In the second example, <strong>than</strong> sets up a comparision between movies and books.
          The adjective phrase <strong>less enjoyable</strong> modifies the noun <strong>movies</strong>. Movies possess the quality of enjoyability to a lesser degree than books do. <br><br>
          That the conjunction <strong>than</strong> is absent, however, does not mean that the sentence cannot contain adjectives in the comparative degree. Sometimes, <strong>than</strong>
          and the items of comparision that follow are implied. They are so obvious that they need not be mentioned. <br>
          I like <strong>larger</strong> cars <strong>better</strong>. <br>
          In this example, the speaker claims to prefer cars that possess a greater degree of largeness over cars that do not. We could have written the sentence in this way: <br>
          I like <strong>larger</strong> cars better than smaller cars.
          <br><br>As you can see, the additional information is not particularly illuminating. The sentence was fine without it. Other sentences are constructed to create the comparision without
          the word <strong>than.</strong> <br>
          The <strong>juicier</strong> the burger is, the <strong>higher</strong> the calories are. <br>
          The comparative degree is exclusive. The main object of comparision is seen as distinct from the objects to which it is compared by virtue of the different degree of its quality. It would
          be a mistake to say, "I enjoy swimming more than anything." Such a statement includes swimming in the group of of objects being compared. The comparative degree is exclusive. Swimming
          is enjoyed more, so it must be separate. Such a sentence should read, "I enjoy swimming more than anything <i>else.</i>" the addition of the word <strong>else</strong>
          separates swimming from the other objects.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>SUPARLATIVE DEGREE</h5>
        <p>
          The suparlative degree is the highest degree of comparision for adjectives. An object modified by an adjective in the suparlative degree holds the greatest or least degree
          of the quality of that adjective. No object can possess a quality to a degree higher than suparlative. This degree compares more than two objects. <br><br>
          The was the <strpng>most digusting</strpng> movie I have ever seen. <br>
          Theirs is the <strong>largest</strong> house in our city. <br>
          That was the <strong>saddest</strong> story I've ever heard. <br>
          Here must be the <strong>least believable</strong> excuse I have ever received from a student. <br><br>
          In the first example, one movie possesses the most disgustingness of any movie seen by that movie-goer. In the second example, one house possesses the most largeness of any house
          in the city. In the third example, one story possesses the most sadness of any story heard by that listner. In the final example, one excuse possesses the least believability of any
          excuse the speaker has ever received. <br><br>
          The suparlative degree often carries a prepositional phrase beginning with <strong>of, among</strong> or <strong>in,</strong> to define the objects among which the comparision is made. <br>
          In the first example, the preposition <strong>in</strong> begins the prepositional phrase <strong>in the ballroom.</strong> This phrase defines the area within which the comparision
          of all girls was made. Of those girls in the ballroom, <i>she</i> was the most beautiful. In the second example, the preposition <strong>of</strong> begins the prepositional phrase
          <strong>of the stories submitted</strong>. The phrase defines the group of stories among which the selection of the best story was made. Of those stories, <i>his</i> story was the best.
          The suparlative degree is inclusive. It includes the main object in the total group of objects that is compared. It is perfectly reasonable to say, "I like swimming the best of anything."
          Since swimming is a part of the group of objects compared, we do not have to use a word such as <strong>else</strong> to create separation. Swimming is included.
        </p><br>

        <h5>FORMS OF COMPARISION</h5>
        <p>
          There are several ways to create the different comparision forms for adjective. We will talk about each of them in turn.
        </p>
        <h6>SUFFIX COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          Most one-syllable and a few two-syllable adjectives have forms of comparision made by the addition of a suffix. To make the comparative form, add <strong>-er</strong> to the positive.
          To make the suparlative form, <strong>-est</strong> to the positive. The positive form itself requires no change.
          <h6 class="text-center">DEGREE OF COMPARISION BY SUFFIX</h6>
          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - He is <strong>angry.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - He is <strong>angrier</strong> than she is. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - He is <strong>angriest</strong> of them all. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - This shirt is <strong>cheap</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - That shirt is <strong>cheaper</strong> than this one. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - The shirt is <strong>chepest</strong> of them all. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - January is <strong>rainy</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - January is <strong>ranier</strong> than February. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - January is <strong>rainiest</strong> of all the months. <br><br>

          Please notice that it is not always a simple matter to add the suffix. Most words require special changes to make the suffix stick
        </p><br>
        <h6>ADVERB COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          Other adjectives, mostly multi-syllable, require the addition of an adverb to create the forms of comparision. An adverb, as we will see in the next chapter, is a modifier that describes a
          verb, an adjective, or another adverb. The adverb we need will precede the adjective they modify. To create comparative forms, use one of the <strong>more</strong> or <strong>less</strong>
          To create the suparlative forms, use one of the adverbs <strong>most</strong> or <strong>least</strong>. To create the suparlative forms, use one of the adverbs <strong>most</strong>
          or <strong>least.</strong> Again, the positive degree require no change in form. <br>
        </p>
        <h6 class="text-center">DEGREES OF COMPARISION BY ADVERB</h6>
        <p>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - This is <strong>bizarre.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - This is more <strong>bizarre</strong>. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - This is most <strong>bizarre</strong>. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - That is <strong>dangerous.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> -That is more <strong>dangerous</strong> than this. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - That is most <strong>dangerous</strong>. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - I feel <strong>tranquil.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - I feel more <strong>tranquil</strong>. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - I feel most <strong>tranquil</strong>. <br><br>

          There is no set rule to follow that will let you know whether your adjective needs an adverb or a suffix to create the form of comparision. Some one-syllable words need an adverb. Some multi-syllable words may take a suffix.
          Your ear is the best judge. Use the version that sounds correct. <br><br>
          Please avoid redundancy in your forms of comparision. Never use a suffix and an adverb with a single adjective. One car is never more cheaper than another. It is simply cheaper. One joke is not the most funniest
          joke ever. It is simply the funniest. One modification of the adjective will suffice.

        </p><br>
        <h6>FORMING THE COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> A high-ranking goverment official spouted, "We need more bolder approaches." A member of the press corps called to ask if the adverb <strong>more</strong>
          was necessary. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>In order to dermine whether <strong>more</strong> was used correctly, it pears between <strong>more</strong> and <strong>bolder</strong>, then each describes the noun <strong>approaches.</strong>
          "We need more, bolder approaches." The politician is asking for approaches that are bolder and greater in frequency. His statement is correct. <br> Without a comma, <strong>more</strong>
          is redundant. The adjective <strong>bolder</strong> alone expresses the comparative degree of <strong>bold</strong>. It is sufficient unto itself and does not require
          the adverb <strong>more</strong>. Under this interpretation, the politician should have said, "We need bolder approaches."
        </p>
        <h6>MUCH MORE SIMPLE VS. SIMPLER</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>A member of the Presidential cabinet spoke a few weeks ago about taking some of the frills out of goverment. He stated, "Let's make this much more simple." <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>In the sentence, <strong>much more simple</strong> describes the pronoun <strong>this.</strong> <strong>Much</strong> is an adverb describing <strong>more</strong>. This cabinet member choose to use the adverb <strong>more</strong>
          to create the comparative form of the adjective <strong>simple</strong>. Couldn't have used <strong>simpler</strong> instead? The sentence would have read, "Let's make this much simpler."
          Either construction is grammatically correct, but the second is more concise and easier to comprehend.
        </p> <br>
        <h6>STRICT, STRICTER, STRICTEST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>Often, a fine line separates the meaning of one word from another. A defense attorney called to ask for an interpretation of a sentence from a document that was crucial to her argument. The sentence read, "The information will be kept in stricter confidence."
          She asked, "What difference does the form of strict make to the sentence?" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          All adjectives have three forms of comparison: the positive
          (<strong>strict</strong>), the comparative (<strong>stricter</strong>), and the superlative
          (<strong>strictest</strong>). The use of the comparative form, stricter, creates a weak
          construction. It tells us nothing about how strict the confidence is
          because we have nothing to compare it to. Is the confidence stricter
          than that kept by a man who shares information freely with anyone
          he meets on the street? If so, it may not be strict at all. Or is it
          stricter than the confidence kept by a tight-lipped Pentagon general? If so, it may be quite strict. <br>
          The author's intent probably was to indicate that the informa
          tion would be put under the tightest security. He should have used
          either the positive or the superlative form. The sentence could read,
          The Information will be kept in the strictest confidence" or "The
          information will be kept in strict confidence." Both imply tight-lipped secrecy.
        </p>
        <h6>IRREGULAR COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          Other adjectives have forms of comparison that defy attempt at formalization. These forms are irregularly compared. Their changes are case-specific, and you must memorize
          each in turn. Here is a partial list: <br><br>
          <p class="text-center"><strong>DEGREES OF IRREGULAR COMPARISION</strong></p>

        <h6>IRREGULAR DISTINCTIONS</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "What is the difference between the adjective <strong>farther</strong> and <strong>further</strong>" asked a sixth-grade teacher from Pennsylvania. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> Some readers may have noticed that a few of the irregularity compared adjectives have different forms in the comparative and suparlative degrees. One of these is the adjective <strong>far</strong>.
          The adjective in the <strong>far -> farther ->farthest</strong> progression refers to physical distance. <br>
          We reached the <strong>farther</strong> shore. <br><br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>far -> furher -> furthest</strong> progression refer to a mental or physical distance. <br>
          We drove the <strong>furthest</strong> distance that we could in a day. (physical distance) <br>
          That is the <strong>furthest</strong> thing from my mind. (mental distance) <br><br>
          Other adjectives carry similar distinctions in their forms of comparision. The adjectives in the <strong>old -> older -> oldest</strong> progression refer to age. <br>
          I am <strong>older</strong> than my sister. <br><br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>old -> elder -> eldest</strong> progression also refers to age but with the implication of advanced age. <br>
          My <strong>eldest</strong> brother is in his eighties. <br><br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>late -> later -> latest</strong> progression refer to order in time. <br>
          The time is <strong>later</strong> than I thought. <br> <br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>late -> latter -> last</strong> progression refer to a physical order in space. <br>
          Tom took the <strong>last</strong> fight home.
        </p><br>
        <h6>BETTER THAN BEST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>In a recent selection, one party ran an advertisement that began with the line "The Incumbent VS. The Challenger: Who is best?" Several callers asked if <strong>best</strong> was correct form of comparision to use. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>Since there are only two people contrasted here, the incumbent and the challenger, the spin doctors should have used
          the comparative form, <strong>better</strong>. "The Incumbent vs. The Challenger
          Who is Better?" Superlative forms, such as best, are reserved for
          situations that compare three or more objects. <br>
        </p>
        <h6>BAD, WORSE, WORST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>  A sports enthusiast called to question a statement made by a
          star athlete. He said, "One of my favorite baseball players
          said, 'We're badder than them.' I know that badder is not correct
          but what could he have said instead?" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>Caller was correct. The statement needed work. The
          forms of comparison for the adjective <strong>bad</strong> are <strong>bad -> worse ->
          worst</strong>. There is no word badder. Taking, proper form and intended meaning into account, he should have said, "We are <i>better</i> than
          they are."
          The National Grammar Hot Line recognizes that <strong>bad, badder,
          and baddest</strong> are slang for "terrific or wonderful," the exact opposite of the literal definitions of the words. The athlete was not
          trying to say that his team was worse than the opposition. Most
          slang is faddish, and some may becocets of the lexicon, but avoid it until it is.
        </p>
        <h6>ADJECTIVES BEYOND COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          A number of adjectives are beyond comparison. The qualities
          that these adjectives express exist in only one degree. To compare
          objects according to one of these qualities creates a moot point
          since all objects with the quality possess it to an equal degree. Here
          is a partial list of uncomparable adjectives:

              <td>fatal</td>
              <td>single</td>

        <p>
        How can one line be more perpendicular than another or the most
        perpendicular of all lines? There is but one degree of perpendicularity, and, to this degree, all things perpendicular are equal. In the
        same way, one accident cannot be more fatal than another. Their
        consequences are identical. They have both caused death. These
        adjectives and others like them are beyond comparison. <br>
        Please note that this uncomparability applies to these adjectives
        under their strictest definitions. English is a flexible language to say
        the least, and many people, expressing themselves in a creative
        way, have uttered one of these adjectives in the comparative or superlative degree. A grief-stricken man might say, "I have never felt
        more alone than I do now." A flea market shopper, using the adjective unique to mean "unusual or distinct," could say, "This is the
        most unique lamp I have ever seen." These sentences contain uncomparable adjectives in comparative and superlative forms.
        Often, the speaker's intention is to indicate that one object more closely approximates the perfect state described by the adjective
        than another. We normal speakers are allowed this same poetic license, but take care that each usage is a sensible one.

       <h6>LESS OR FEWER</h6>
       <p>
         <strong>Q. </strong>"How can I keep less and fewer straight? I always confuse
          them, and I don't understand the difference," stated an irritable copywriter. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          Both words are adjectives. <strong>Less</strong> modifies nouns that name a
          whole or a collection but are singular in number. <strong>Fewer</strong> modifies nouns that name a number of separate objects and are plural.
          For instance, one would have <strong>less</strong> knowledge but <strong>fewer</strong> facts, <strong>less</strong>
          time but <strong>fewer</strong> minutes, <strong>less</strong> heat but <strong>fewer</strong> fires, <strong>less</strong> congestion
          but <strong>fewer</strong> cars, <strong>less</strong> traffic but <strong>fewer</strong> accidents, and <strong>less</strong> inclement
          weather but <strong>fewer</strong> storms.

      <div class="">
        <h3>POSITIONING THE ADJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>
          The conscientious grammarian needs to know where to place
          his or her adjectives. An adjective can either precede or follow the
          noun that it modifies, depending upon a number of factors which
          we will now consider.
        </p><br>
        <h5>TYPICAL USAGE</h5>
        <p>
          Adjectives typically precede the nouns that they modify. <br><br>
          My <strong>tired</strong> feet need a massage. <br>
          The birds' calls blended into a <strong>sweet</strong> song. <br>
          I appeal to your keen intellect. <br><br>
          In the first example, the adjective <strong>tired</strong> precedes the noun modified, <strong>feet</strong>. In the second example, the adjective <strong>sweet</strong> precedes the
          noun modified, <strong>song</strong>, In the third example, the adjective <strong>keen</strong> precedes the noun modified, <strong>intellect</strong>.
        </p><br>
        <h5>SPECIAL USAGE</h5>
        <p>
          Some adjectives are placed after the nouns they modify for no
          discernible reason. This is merely the way it is done. For instance
          we speak of a notary public, a court martial, and an attorney general.
          The adjective <strong>public</strong> describes the noun <strong>notary</strong>, the adjective
          <strong>martial</strong> describes the noun </strong>court, and the adjective <strong>general</strong> describes
          the noun <strong>attorney</strong>. Typical adjective usage suggests that we
          "public notary" or "martial court" or "general attorney," but
          actual usage dictates otherwise. These instances you must learn on
          a case-by-case basis.
        </p><br>
        <h5>EMPHATIC USAGE</h5>
        <p>
          Place the adjective after the noun modified to emphasize the
          qualities described by the adjective. <br><br>
          A man, <strong>old</strong> and <strong>wise</strong>, gave me these instructions. <br>
          Can you hear the emphasis that the alternative placement puts on
          the adjectives <strong>old</strong> and <strong>wise</strong>? Their position highlights the man's
          age and wisdom. The sentence could just as well read, "An old,
          wise man gave me these instructions." But such a construction removes the emphasis from the adjectives.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>USAGE AS OBJECT COMPLEMENTS</h5>
        <p>
          Adjectives that serve as object complements follow the direct
          objects that they modify. <br><br>
          Have you heard anything <strong>new</strong>? <br>
          I asked you to bring something <strong>blue</strong>. <br>
          We found her <strong>tiresome</strong>. <br>
          That made me <strong>hungry</strong>. <br><br>
          In the first example, the adjective <strong>new</strong> is the object complement
          of the direct object <strong>anything</strong>. In the second example, the adjective
          <strong>blue</strong> is the object complement of the direct object <strong>something</strong>. In the
          third example, the adjective<strong> tiresome</strong> is the object complement of
          the direct object <strong>her</strong>. In the fourth example, the adjective <strong>hungry</strong> is
          the object complement of the direct object <strong>me</strong>.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>USAGE AS SUBJECT COMPLEMENTS</h5>
        <p>
          Adjectives used as subject complements must follow linking verbs and
          so, by necessity, follow the nouns and pronouns that they modify. <br><br>
          My feet are <strong>cold</strong>. <br>
          The cat looks <strong>frightened</strong>. <br>
          The milk smells <strong>rotten</strong>. <br><br>
          In the first example, the adjective <strong>cold</strong> follows the linking verb
          <strong>are </strong> and complements the noun <strong>feet</strong>. In the second example, the
          adjective <strong>frightened</strong> follows the linking verb </strong>looks</strong> and complements
          the noun <strong>cat</strong>. In the third example, the adjective <strong>rotten</strong> follows the
          linking verb <strong>smells</strong> and complements the noun <strong>milk</strong>.
        </p>
        <h5>MISPLACED MODIFIER</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>A chuckling newspaper editor called to tell me about an ad
          that was to appear in the next day's edition. The ad read,
          "Huge Fan Sale!" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          Whoa! Those are some big fans! I wondered exactly how
          large the devices were. So did he. We generally assume that
          an adjective describes the noun it is nearest to. In this case, the ad-
          jective huge is nearest to the noun <strong>fan</strong>. It appears that <strong>huge</strong>
          modifies <strong>fan</strong>, but the meaning is quite absurd. Who ever heard of a
          sale of oversized fans? <strong>Huge</strong> actually modifies the noun <strong>sale</strong>
          Corrected, the ad should read, "Huge Sale of Fans." <br>
          In a similar grammar gaffe, I was recently offered a hot cup of
          coffee. I refused, fearing that it might burn my fingers, and, instead, asked for a cup of hot coffee. Take care that you don't
          misplace your modifier.

        <h3>SOME OTHER THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT ADJECTIVES</h3>
        <p>
          Please pay careful attention to these additional adjective issues.
        </p><br>
        <h5>NOUNS AS ADJECTIVES</h5>
        <p>
          English speakers often use nouns in such a way that they modify other nouns. In these cases, the nouns function as adjectives. <br><br>
          My father built a <strong>log</strong> cabin in the woods. <br>
          The outlaw stepped through the saloon door. <br>
          Our tile roof is leaking. <br><br>
          The words <strong>log, saloon,</strong> and <strong>tile</strong> are nouns, but they function in
          these sentences as adjectives. <strong>Log</strong> modifies <strong>cabin</strong>. It indicates what kind of cabin was built. <strong>Saloon</strong> modifies <strong>door</strong>.
          It describes what kind of door was stepped through. <strong>Tile</strong> modifies <strong>roof.</strong> It explains what kind of roof was leaking. <br><br>
          Possessive case nouns frequently function as adjectives while
          retaining their ability to show possession. <br><br>
          My <strong>sister's</strong> car was stolen. <br>
          <strong>Bob's</strong> painting is beautiful. <br><br>
          In the first example, the possessive noun <strong>sister's</strong> modifies <strong>car</strong>. It indicates whose car was stolen. In the second example, the possessive
          noun <strong>Bob's</strong> modifies <strong>painting</strong>. It tells whose painting is beautiful.
          Each of these examples shows a typical noun working at the job of
          an adjective.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>DESCRIBING A SALES POSITION</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>Should I be called 'Northwest Regional Manager' or
          'Northwestern Regional Manager'?" asked a newly-promoted executive. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>There are several directions in which to go. <strong>Northwest</strong> is a
          noun. As you know, nouns can be used as adjectives, and this
          noun is in the title <strong>Northwest Regional Manager</strong>. <strong>Northwestern</strong>
          on the other hand, is an adjective and can describe a noun such as
          <strong>manager</strong> in the title <strong>Northwestern Regional Manager</strong>. With the
          same adjective, we could also use the title <strong>Northwestern Region
          Manager</strong>, where <strong>Northwestern</strong> describes the noun <strong>region</strong>. Any
          one is acceptable. An oddity to note: Northwestern University in
          Evanston, Illinois, is not in the northwestern portion of the country
          at all but was in the Northwest Territory when the school opened
          in 1851.
        </p>
        <h5>UNGRAMMATICALLY PLEASANT</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> A realtor questioned a description he had written of a
          house. He asked, "Is it OK for me to write, 'Two story house
          for sale.' " <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          Since there are two stories to this house, the description
          should read, "Two stories house for sale." There are two, so
          the noun <strong>story</strong> must be plural. Of course, "two story house" is cooquial. Through common usage, it has become an accepted and
          agreeabl construction, but it is not correct. As much as I wanted to
          instruct the realtor to use the version with proper grammar, I could
          not do so in good conscience. A man who wants to sell houses
          needs to please his customers. Here, it is the ungrammatical version that pleases most ears.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>OVERUSED ADJECTIVES</h5>
        <p>
          A troubled high school sophomore called with this to say:. "My English teacher marks me down for using certain words in my papers. If I say something is 'nice' or 'funny,' she takes
          points off, and I'm ending up with too many C's. They seem like okay words. Why is she doing this to me?" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>This young man's teacher and I must share a pet peeve. I am
          continually being irked by word choices such as the ones this fellow has just described. Too many speakers and writers make annoyingly uninformative adjective choices. Adjectives such as <strong>nice</strong>
          or <strong>cute</strong> are used in so many different contexts that their presence tells us nothing about the nouns that they modify. I may mention
          that we had a <strong>nice</strong> afternoon or that she was wearing a <strong>cute</strong> dress,
          but have I revealed anything interesting? No, I have not. If I had
          been thinking. I would have mentioned our <strong>wonderful</strong> afternoon
          and her <strong>stunning</strong> dress. Now that is information. These adjectives
          better communicate the meanings desired. Some other overused
          adjectives are <strong>cute, funny, good, great,</strong> and the currently popular
          <strong>awesome</strong>. <br><br>
          Do not be overzealous in your use of adjectives either. Over-description, redundancy, and ambiguity have ruined many a fine
          sentence. Be wise in your choices. Select only those adjectives that
          truly add color or flavor to your words and leave the remainder of
          the description to context. <br><br>
          The prevailing literary posture, which has existed since pen was
          first put to paper and still exists today, that nouns and verbs should
          carry the action and that the overuse of adjectives weakens prose, is
          one that Ernest Hemingway took seriously. To be sure that he didn't
          overuse adjectives, he often took his writings to the poet Ezra
          Pound for proofing. Despite his vigilance, Hemingway couldn't deo
          without adjectives entirely. In fact, he used seven in the first two
          sentences of his novel <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>.
          "In the <strong>late</strong> summer of that year we lived in a house in a village
          that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed
          of the river there were pebbles and boulders, <strong>dry</strong> and <strong>white</strong> in
          sun, and the water was <strong>clear</strong> and swiftly <strong>moving</strong> and <strong>blue</strong> in
          the channels."
        </p><br>
          <h5>ANOTHER MISUSE</h5>
          <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>I heard a famous defense lawyer say, 'I need to concise this.
          . Can you change an adjective into a verb like this?" asked a
          caller. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans.</strong><strong>Concise</strong> is an adjective. It is not a verb. One cannot <i>concise</i>
          anything. The attorney could have asked his aid to make this
          concise, whatever "this" was. Famous or not, the attorney gets an
          "F" in grammar.

        <h3>DETERMINERS</h3>
        <p>
          Grammar is by no means cut and dry. As depth of understanding increases, the old, familiar ways of approaching a topic become inadequate and the need for new principles arises.
          At the beginning of the chapter, we discussed a class of adjectives called
          <strong>limiting adjectives</strong>. While this category is certainly descriptive of
          the functions of its members, there is a more sophisticated way of
          viewing these words. Modern grammarians define a class of words
          called <strong>determiners</strong>. A determiner is a word that determines the reference of a noun phrase. The category of determiners includes the
          articles, <strong>a, an,</strong> or <strong>the</strong>; the demonstrative pronouns, <strong>this, that, those</strong>
          or <strong>these</strong>; the possessive pronouns, such as <strong>my, her</strong>, or <strong>their</strong>; and
          the interrogative pronouns, such as <strong>who, which</strong>, or <strong>what</strong>: among
          others. Words of this type aid the  reader or listener in determining which person, place, thing
          or idea  is named by the noun phrase that the writer or speaker has
          written or spoken. <br><br>
          I sat on <strong>the</strong> porch. <br>
          <strong>This</strong> idea is not a good one. <br>
          She left <strong>her</strong> coat at the skating rink. <br>
          <strong>Which</strong> movie did you decide to see? <br><br>
          in the first example, the article <strong>the</strong> is a determiner that modifies the
          noun <strong>porch</strong>. In the second example, the demonstrative pronoun
          <strong>this</strong> is a determiner that modifies the noun <strong>idea</strong>. In the third example, the possessive pronoun <strong>her</strong> is a determiner that modifies the
          noun <strong>coat</strong>, In the fourth example, the interrogative pronoun <strong>which</strong>
          is a determiner that modifies the noun <strong>movie</strong>. <br><br>
          Number or quantity words, such as <strong>one, all, third</strong>, or <strong>three-
          fifths</strong>, also function as determiners. These determiners are often
          used in conjunction with other determiners so that two or more preceds the noun modified. <br><br>
          Buddy drank <strong>all the</strong> milk. <br>
          The runners have completed <strong>the first three</strong> laps. <br><br>
          In the first example, <strong>all</strong> and <strong>the</strong> are determiners that modify the
          noun <strong>milk</strong>. In the second example, <strong>the, first</strong>, and <strong>three</strong> are
          determiners that modify the noun <strong>laps</strong>. <br><br>
    		  When using number words, it is important to keep the difference between <strong>cardinal numbers</strong> and <strong>ordinal numbers</strong> in mind.
    			Cardinal numbers are counting numbers. They express absolute
    			number without any implication of position. The following is a
    			brief list of cardinal numbers: <br> one, thirty-two, one million, one quintillion. <br><br>
    			The ordinal numbers, on the other hand, are position numbers.
    			They correspond to the cardinal numbers but indicate position it
    			relation to other numbers. The ordinal numbers all carry a suffix
    			<strong>nd, rd, st, or th</strong>. The following is a brief list of ordinal numbers. <br> first, thirty-second, one millionnth, one quintillionnth
    			<br><br>
    			When a cardinal number and an ordinal number modify the
    			same noun, the ordinal number always precedes the cardinal number. <br><br>
    			The <strong>first two</strong> operations were the most difficult to watch. <br>
    			The second three innings were quite dull. <br><br>
    			the first example, the ordinal number <strong>first</strong> precedes the cardinal number <strong>two</strong>.
    			Both <strong>first</strong> and <strong>two</strong> are determiners. In the second example, the ordinal number
    			<strong>second</strong> precedes the cardinal number
    			<strong>three</strong>. Both <strong>second</strong> and <strong>three</strong> are determiners. Try reading the sentences with the ordinal and cardinal numbers reversed. They
    			simpy wrong.
        </p><br>
    		<h5>APPROACHING INFINITY</h5>
    		<p>
    			<strong>Q. </strong>"What is the largest counting number word that you have
    			ever heard of?" asked an elementary school math teacher
    			from Phoenix, Arizona. <br><br>
    			<strong></strong>The largest word for a cardinal number or counting number
    			that I've heard of is the word <strong>googolplex</strong>. One <strong>googol</strong> is ten
    			raised to the power of one hundred. One googolplex is 10
    			raised to the power of googol.
    			To write this number the long way, you would write a numeral 1
    			followed by a googol of Os. Believe me, it's not worth it. This is an
    			inconceivably large number.
    		</p><br>
    		<h5>ARTICLES</h5>
    		<p>
    			Our discussion of determiners would not be complete without
    			mention of <strong>articles</strong>. This class has only three members: <strong>a, an</strong>, and
    			<strong>the</strong>. Their function is to determine the references of nouns.
    			Traditionally, the trio has been included among adjectives, but contemporary grammarians have begun viewing articles as a separate
    			part of speech and include them among the category of words
    			called determiners. The function of an article, after all, is to limit,
    			point out, or <i>determine</i> a noun.
      	</p> <br>
        <h6>POSITIONING ARTICLE</h6>
        <p>
          In most cases, the article directly precedes the noun that it determines or modifies. <br><br>
    			<strong>An alligator</strong> crawled from <strong>the river</strong>. <br>
    			<strong>The baby</strong> cried for <strong>an hour</strong>. <br>
          <strong>A woman</strong> left <strong>the package an hour</strong> ago. <br><br>
          Sometimes, however, a modifier or a series of modifiers will separate the article and the noun. <br><br>
          <strong>A</strong> tall, dark <strong>stranger</strong> walked into <strong>the</strong> cluttered <strong>office.</strong> <br>
          <strong>The</strong> smaller <strong>version</strong> is <strong>a</strong> better <strong>bargain</strong>.
        </p> <br>
        <h6>INDEFINITE AND DEFINITE ARTICLE</h6>
        <p>
          There are two types of articles: <strong>indetinite</strong> and <strong>definite</strong>. The indefinite articles are <strong>a</strong> and <strong>an</strong>. We use <strong>a</strong> before words that begin with
          consonant sounds: <strong>a house, a car, a motorcycle, a brilliant scietist</strong>. We use <strong>an</strong> before words that begin with vowel sounds: <strong>an
          airplane, an umbrella, an exit, an admirable goal</strong>. These articles are indefinite because they do not point to any noun in particular.
          When we speak of "a destination," we aren't speaking of any destination in particular. Similarly, if we write of "an idea," we don't
          have any specific idea in mind. <br><br>
          Determining which indefinite article to use is not as simple as seeing whether the following word begins with a consonant or a
          vowel. The article <strong>an</strong> sometimes precedes words that begin with a consonant but that are pronounced with an initial vowel sound: <strong>an
          honor, an hour</strong>. The article <strong>a</strong> sometimes precedes words that begin
          with a vowel but that are pronounced with an initial consonant
          sound: <strong>a unicorn, a unit</strong>. Both of these words begin with the <strong>/y/</strong>
          sound in <strong>yoo</strong>. A few words are pronounced with either an initial
          consonant or an initial vowel sound: <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an history</strong>, <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an hotel</strong>
          In these cases, choose the article that fits your pronunciation. <br><br>
          The definite article <strong>the</strong>, on the other hand, points to particular
          people, places, things, and ideas. When we speak of "the dog," we
          are referring to one dog in particular. When we say "the closet.
          there is only one closet that we could mean. We use the definite a
          ticle when we are certain that the reader or listener knows which
          person, place, thing, or idea the noun names. <br><br>
          <strong>The man</strong> you just mentioned stopped by. <br>
          <strong>The car</strong> is in the garage. <br><br>
          In the first example, we use the definite article <strong>the</strong> with the noun
          <strong>man</strong> because the individual named by the  noun has already been mentioned. In
          the second example, we use the definite article <strong>the</strong>
          with the noun <strong>car</strong> because this particular car is so familiar to the
          person or people to whom the sentence is directed that it needs no
          other identification. <br>
          The pronunciation of the definite article changes, depending
          upon the initial sound of the word that it precedes. If the word begins with a consonant sound, the <strong>e</strong> in <strong>the</strong> is pronounced "uh": <strong>the</strong>
          (thuh) <strong>ball</strong>, <strong>the</strong> (thuh) <strong>bat</strong>. If the word begins with a vowel sound
          the <strong>e</strong> makes a long vowel sound like in <strong>sweet</strong>: <strong>the</strong> (thee) <strong>automobile</strong>, <strong>the</strong> (thee) <strong>exorcist</strong>.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>AN ARTICLE QUESTION</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>One perturbed caller commented, "If the President doesn't
          know the right word, how should we know it? As a highly
          educated person, shouldn't the country's leader know his grammar? I heard him say 'an historic event' at a press conference." <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>The caller should have kept his pants on. The President
          o could have been correct. <strong>Historic</strong> is a word with two pronunciations. In certain regional dialects, the <strong>h</strong> can be silent, so tha
          the word is pronounced "istoric," or the <strong>h</strong> can be vocalized in standard pronunciation, so that the word begins with a strong, breathy
          <strong>/h/</strong> sound, "historic." In the former case, the word begins with a
          vowel sound, so the article needed is an. In the latter case, the word
          begins with a consonant sound, so the article needed is a. I'm
          guessing that the President chose the former option and used the
          correct article. <br><br>
          Folks, the <strong>a-an</strong> distinction exists only to make our lives easier,
          not to confuse us. Try saying "a inner tube" out loud. It's awkward
          Now use the correct article, <strong>an</strong>. The words flow smoothly. We use
          the article that allows us to speak in an easier manner. The
          President selected the option that worked the best for him
        </p> <br>
        <h5>ARTICLES AND ABBREVIATIONS</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>Should I put a or an before our company's abbreviation?"
          asked an executive secretary. "The abbreviation is S.P.U" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>The rule dictates that <strong>a</strong> precedes words that begin with a
          consonant sound and that <strong>an</strong> precedes words that begin with
          vowel sound. The answer to the question depends on how one
          says the company's name. If each letter is pronounced, then the
          first sound in the letter <strong>s</strong> is a vowel sound (the short <strong>/e/</strong> sound in
          <strong>ěs</strong>). The article <strong>an</strong> would be appropriate: an S.P.U. If one pronounces the three letters as a single word (spoo, perhaps), then the
          first sound is a consonant sound. The article <strong>a</strong> would be appropriate: a S.P.U
        </p>
        <h5>EUCHARIST</h5>
        <p>
        <strong>Q. </strong>Should <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong> be used before Eucharist?" asked a church
        e member. <br><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Although the noun <strong>Eucharist</strong> begins with a vowel, it is pronounced with an initial consonant sound, the <strong>/y/</strong> sound in
        <strong>yoo</strong>. Therefore, we say, "a Eucharist." We make the same choice
        with words such as <strong>unicorn</strong> and <strong>eunuch</strong>. By the way, the term
        <strong>Eucharist</strong> refers to the sacrament of Holy Communion and to the
        sacred elements of Holy Communion, the bread and wine, in the
        Christian Church.
      </p> <br>
        <h5>ADJECTIVES, ARTICIES, AND NOUNS</h5>
        <p>
        <strong>Q. </strong>A businessman called with an intriguing question. He asked
        . "What happens to an adjective when you put an article in
        front of it? I was watching TV with my kids and the announcer said
        that they would be broadcasting 'a special' shortly. Special is an ad
        jective in the dictionary, but it was being used like a noun on TV." <br><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>This fellow's consternation was understandable. We often see
        words that we associate with one part of speech used as
        other parts of speech. In this case, the word <strong>special</strong>, which we typically associate with adjectives, was being used as a noun. Its
        unusual function was due to the presence of the article before it. <br><br>
        Each article possesses the amazing ability to transform an adjective into a noun. Place <strong>a, an</strong>, or <strong>the</strong> in front of an adjective and
        suddenly it has the effect of a noun in the sentence. We see <strong>a
        Western</strong> at the movies, and we watch <strong>a special</strong> on television. We
        attend <strong>a spectacular</strong> at the local civic arena, and, at baseball games,
        we sing of the land of <strong>the free</strong> and the home of <strong>the brave</strong>. Doctors
        treat <strong>the sick</strong>, humanitarians help <strong>the poor</strong>, and Catherine <strong>the
        Great</strong> ruled Russia. The words<strong> Western, special, spectacular, free,
        rave, sick, poor</strong>, and <strong>Great</strong> (an epithet) are all adjectives doing the jobs of nouns, thanks to articles.
      </p> <br>
        <h5>FROM MY FILES: THE EVOLUTION OF NICE</h5>
        <p>
        Few words have gone through as many changes as the adjective nice. Through the years, nice has meant "silly," "simple,"
        "ignorant," "foolish," "wanton," and even "lascivious." Old French
        lent the word to English in the thirteenth century when it meant
        "silly" or "simple." It was based on the Latin, <strong>nescius</strong>, meaning
        "ignorant," from <strong>nescire</strong>, "to be ignorant." Obviously, there has
        been an extreme shift since then! <br><br>
        At first, the English meaning was the same as the French with a
        shade of "stupid" or "foolish." In the fourteenth century, the meaning of <strong>nice</strong> changed to "wanton," and even "indecent" or "lewd."
        In the fifteenth century, <strong>nice</strong> acquired the sense of "coy" and "shy,"
        but all of these meanings are now obsolete. <br><br>
        In the sixteenth century came a shift in connotation to "sensitive, critical discernment," as in "a nice distinction" or "a nice piece
        of craftsmanship." This Renaissance meaning lasted until the eighteenth century, when it finally evolved into the modern <strong>nice</strong>,
        meaning "pleasing," "agreeable," or "delicately discriminating."
