      <h1 class="my-4 text-center">ADJECTIVES</h1>

      <div class="border p-4 my-3 h3 font-weight-normal Ubuntu text-center">
        <p>
          <strong>Adjectives</strong> are words that modify nouns or pronouns .
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <p>
          One task of language is to paint a picture. If verbs and nouns are outlines and shapes, then adjectives are colors and textures. Adjectives fall into a broad class of words called <strong>modifiers</strong>.
          A modifiers is any word that acts to describe or qualify another words in such a way that it changes the other word's meaning. Describing and qualifying nouns and pronouns are the primary function of adjectives.
          <br><br>Here is a simple example: "I watched a movie on television." This sentence is not terribly informative or inspirational because it lacks adjectives. To accurately describe
          the wonders of modern technology, we need to add some color: "I watched the <strong>greatest action </strong> movie of all time, <i>Star Wars,</i> on my <strong>new, delightally-enhanced</strong>
          television." The addition of the adjectives changes what we know of the nouns.
        </p>

      <div class="">
        <h3>TYPES OF ADJECTIVES</h3>
        <p>
          There are two main flavors of adjective: <strong>descriptive</strong> and <strong>limiting.</strong>
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase">Descriptive adjectives </h5>
        <p>
          Descriptive adjectives describe the nouns and pronouns they modify. They point out color, shape, texture, scent or any other quality that entities named by nouns and pronouns can
          possess.This is the function of the adjective with which we are the most familiar. <br><br>
          The <strong>hot</strong> pan burnt my fingers. <br>
          I'll have a <strong>tall</strong> glass of lemonade. <br>
          I am <strong>thirsty.</strong> <br><br>

          In the first example, the adjective <strong>hot</strong> describes the noun <strong>pan.</strong> In the second example, the adjective <strong>tall</strong> describes the noun <strong>glass</strong>.
          In the third example, the adjective <strong>thirsty</strong> describes the pronouns<strong> I.</strong> <br><br>
          Some of the descriptive adjectives are also <strong>proper adjectives,</strong> derived from proper nouns. Usually, the proper noun undergoes some mild changes in form on its way to becoming an adjective.
          The proper noun <strong>America</strong> changes into proper adjective <strong>American.</strong> The proper noun <strong>Orwell</strong> turns into the proper adjective <strong>Orwellian.</strong>
          <br><br><strong>America</strong> had no idea what one day would be <strong>American.</strong> <br>
          <strong>Orwell</strong> imagined a bleak, <strong>Orwellian</strong> future. <br><br>
          Proper adjectives need to be capitalized as are the proper nounsin which they have origins.
        </p> <br>
        <h6>CHOOSING THE CORRECT ADJECTIVE</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "My boyfriend said to me, 'That is heaven.' Shouldn't he have said 'That is heavenly'?" asked a young woman. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> The young lady was, indeed,correct. <strong>Heaven</strong> is a noun. It names the place in which her boyfriend found himself. <strong>Heavenly</strong>
          is an adjective. It describes the feelings her boyfriend had. He should have said, "That is heavenly."
        </p><br>
        <h6>THE NATURE OF MANIFEST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "Is <strong>manifest</strong> a verb or an adjective?" Inquired a historian who frequented the Hot Line. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> <strong>Manifest</strong> can be a verb or an adjectives. As an adjective, it means "evident or obvious." <br>
          His destiny is <strong>manifest.</strong> <br>
          We discussed the <strong>manifest</strong> content of my dream. <br><br>
          As a verb, it means "to become obvious." <br>
          Her happiness <strong>manifested</strong> itself in her smile. <br>
          His curiosity <strong>manifests</strong> itself in his question. <br><br>
          Be aware that there is another adjective, <strong>manifestable,</strong> derived from the verb. <br>
          His guilt was <strong>manifestable</strong> because of the strong evidence. <br>
          Your unconscious desires are <strong>manifestable</strong> under the therapist's tutelage.
          <br>Manifestable means "able to become obvious."
        </p> <br>
        <h5>LIMITING ADJECTIVE</h5>
        <p>
          Limiting adjectives restrict the definitions of the nouns and pronouns they modify. The demonstrative pronouns sometimes function as limiting adjectives because they point
          out certain objects from a group. <br> <strong>This</strong> dog is mine. <br><br>
          Which dog is mine? This dog is mine. Not that dog or that dog. That other dog over there isn't either. This dog here in front of me is mine. The demonstrative pronoun <strong>this</strong>
          limits the meaning of the noun <strong>dog</strong> by identifying it with a single animal. <br><br>
          Most standard limiting adjectives describe quantity. These include the numbers, <strong>one, two, three,</strong> etc., and assorted quantity such as <strong>half, double, daily,</strong> and <strong>weekly</strong>, among others. <br>
          I found <strong>five</strong> dollar in my pocket. <br>
          I read the <strong>daily</strong> paper. <br><br>
          The adjective in the first example answers the question "How many dollars did I find?" The answer is "five dollars." The adjective <strong>five</strong> limits the meaning of the noun <strong>dollars</strong>
          by telling how many were found. Because of its influence, we know the five, and not one, ten, or twenty dollars, was found. <br>
          The adjective in the second example answers the question "What kind of paper do I read?" The answer is "a daily paper." The adjective daily limits the meaning of the noun <strong>paper.</strong>
          It tells us that the paper is the daily kind, not the biweekly, monthly, or yearly kind.
        </p>
        <h6>FROM MY FILES: POLITICALLY CORRECT GRAMMAR</h6>
        <p>
          I recently heard the mayor of a major American city speak about the battle raging between grammatical and political correctness. What are the difference between words or phrases that are politically correctlyand their
          and their grammatically correct counterparts? There need not be any difference at all. Speech can be both grammatically correct and socially aware. What identifications do you
          make with each of these pairs of labels: a blind Indian vs. a visually impaired Native American, a barmaid vs. a bardender, a third-world country vs. a developing nation, ignorant vs. educationally disadvantagedd, a salesman vs. a salesperson, a
          chairman vs. a chair? The first in each pair is outdated and politically incorrect, whereas the second is sensitive,  modern, <i>and</i> grammatically correct. <br><br>
          While it is important that our words show respect, we must not let our desires not to offend carry our speech to a ridiculous extreme. Author Sue Grafton twits political correctness
          in her book. <i>L is for Lawless</i> by deliberately forming some strange constructions. She names a girl stewardperson instead of a stewardess, places a bellhuman in place
          of a bellboy, and asked that desks be "personed" insted of "manned." Whichever words you choose, be aware that they can elicit a smile or a frown.

      <div class="">
        <h3>DEGREE OF COMPARISION</h3>
        <p>
          The primary characteristic of the adjective is its lack of characteristics, its ease of use. Unlike nouns, pronouns, and verbs, which trouble us with form of changes and gender and number and
          case and person, adjectives are a very static bunch. English, unlike almost all other languages, has smartly decided that modifiers should not be affected by those troublesome properties.
          The word <strong>beautiful</strong> remains the same whether it applies to a man or a woman, a boy or a girl, a dog or a cat, a car or a painting. So it is with the rest of the adjectives. <br>
          The one characteristics that adjectives do possess is that of comparision. Many times, it is necessary to express the degree of a quality that one  object possess in relation to other objects.
          We can manipulate the form of adjective to express this relationship. There are three levels of comparision: <strong>positive, comparative, and suparlative.</strong>
        </p> <br>
        <h5>POSITIVE DEGREE</h5>
        <p>
          The positive degree, the adjective in its most basic form, indicates a lack of comparision. An adjective in the positive degree expresses the pure quality of an object without making
          a comparision with other objects. <br><br>
          The night is <strong>warm.</strong><br>
          Anna's dress is <strong>beautiful.</strong> <br>
          Her <strong>long</strong> hair shimmers in the moonlight.<br><br>
          In each examples, the adjectives names a quality of a single object without making any comparision.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>COMPARATIVE DEGREE</h5>
        <p>
          In the comparative degree, one object holds a greater or lesser degree of a quality than the object(s) with which it is compared. Often, this degree compares just two objects. <br><br>
          This house is <strong>smaller</strong> than that one. <br>
          This painting is <strong>more beautiful</strong> than that one. <br>
          The waves today are <strong>less voilent</strong> than the ones yesterday. <br><br>
          In the first example, one house possesses the quality of smallness to a greater degree than another house. In the second example, one painting possesses a greater degree of beauty than another
          painting. In the final example, one set of waves is seen a possessing a lesser degree of voilence than another set. <br>Comparision in the comparative degree is often created after
          the adjective by the conjunction <strong>than</strong>. This conjunction sets up the objects with which the main object is compared. <br>
          I think ice cream is tastier <strong>than</strong> cake. <br>
          Beth believe that movies are less enjoyable <strong>than</strong> books. <br><br>
          In the first example, <strong>than</strong> sets up a comparision between ice cream and cake. The adjective <strong>tastier</strong> modifies the noun <strong>ice cream</strong>
          Ice cream possesses the quality of tastiness to a greater degree than cake does. In the second example, <strong>than</strong> sets up a comparision between movies and books.
          The adjective phrase <strong>less enjoyable</strong> modifies the noun <strong>movies</strong>. Movies possess the quality of enjoyability to a lesser degree than books do. <br><br>
          That the conjunction <strong>than</strong> is absent, however, does not mean that the sentence cannot contain adjectives in the comparative degree. Sometimes, <strong>than</strong>
          and the items of comparision that follow are implied. They are so obvious that they need not be mentioned. <br>
          I like <strong>larger</strong> cars <strong>better</strong>. <br>
          In this example, the speaker claims to prefer cars that possess a greater degree of largeness over cars that do not. We could have written the sentence in this way: <br>
          I like <strong>larger</strong> cars better than smaller cars.
          <br><br>As you can see, the additional information is not particularly illuminating. The sentence was fine without it. Other sentences are constructed to create the comparision without
          the word <strong>than.</strong> <br>
          The <strong>juicier</strong> the burger is, the <strong>higher</strong> the calories are. <br>
          The comparative degree is exclusive. The main object of comparision is seen as distinct from the objects to which it is compared by virtue of the different degree of its quality. It would
          be a mistake to say, "I enjoy swimming more than anything." Such a statement includes swimming in the group of of objects being compared. The comparative degree is exclusive. Swimming
          is enjoyed more, so it must be separate. Such a sentence should read, "I enjoy swimming more than anything <i>else.</i>" the addition of the word <strong>else</strong>
          separates swimming from the other objects.
        </p> <br>
        <h5>SUPARLATIVE DEGREE</h5>
        <p>
          The suparlative degree is the highest degree of comparision for adjectives. An object modified by an adjective in the suparlative degree holds the greatest or least degree
          of the quality of that adjective. No object can possess a quality to a degree higher than suparlative. This degree compares more than two objects. <br><br>
          The was the <strpng>most digusting</strpng> movie I have ever seen. <br>
          Theirs is the <strong>largest</strong> house in our city. <br>
          That was the <strong>saddest</strong> story I've ever heard. <br>
          Here must be the <strong>least believable</strong> excuse I have ever received from a student. <br><br>
          In the first example, one movie possesses the most disgustingness of any movie seen by that movie-goer. In the second example, one house possesses the most largeness of any house
          in the city. In the third example, one story possesses the most sadness of any story heard by that listner. In the final example, one excuse possesses the least believability of any
          excuse the speaker has ever received. <br><br>
          The suparlative degree often carries a prepositional phrase beginning with <strong>of, among</strong> or <strong>in,</strong> to define the objects among which the comparision is made. <br>
          In the first example, the preposition <strong>in</strong> begins the prepositional phrase <strong>in the ballroom.</strong> This phrase defines the area within which the comparision
          of all girls was made. Of those girls in the ballroom, <i>she</i> was the most beautiful. In the second example, the preposition <strong>of</strong> begins the prepositional phrase
          <strong>of the stories submitted</strong>. The phrase defines the group of stories among which the selection of the best story was made. Of those stories, <i>his</i> story was the best.
          The suparlative degree is inclusive. It includes the main object in the total group of objects that is compared. It is perfectly reasonable to say, "I like swimming the best of anything."
          Since swimming is a part of the group of objects compared, we do not have to use a word such as <strong>else</strong> to create separation. Swimming is included.
        </p><br>

        <h5>FORMS OF COMPARISION</h5>
        <p>
          There are several ways to create the different comparision forms for adjective. We will talk about each of them in turn.
        </p>
        <h6>SUFFIX COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          Most one-syllable and a few two-syllable adjectives have forms of comparision made by the addition of a suffix. To make the comparative form, add <strong>-er</strong> to the positive.
          To make the suparlative form, <strong>-est</strong> to the positive. The positive form itself requires no change.
          <h6 class="text-center">DEGREE OF COMPARISION BY SUFFIX</h6>
          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - He is <strong>angry.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - He is <strong>angrier</strong> than she is. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - He is <strong>angriest</strong> of them all. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - This shirt is <strong>cheap</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - That shirt is <strong>cheaper</strong> than this one. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - The shirt is <strong>chepest</strong> of them all. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - January is <strong>rainy</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - January is <strong>ranier</strong> than February. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - January is <strong>rainiest</strong> of all the months. <br><br>

          Please notice that it is not always a simple matter to add the suffix. Most words require special changes to make the suffix stick
        </p><br>
        <h6>ADVERB COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          Other adjectives, mostly multi-syllable, require the addition of an adverb to create the forms of comparision. An adverb, as we will see in the next chapter, is a modifier that describes a
          verb, an adjective, or another adverb. The adverb we need will precede the adjective they modify. To create comparative forms, use one of the <strong>more</strong> or <strong>less</strong>
          To create the suparlative forms, use one of the adverbs <strong>most</strong> or <strong>least</strong>. To create the suparlative forms, use one of the adverbs <strong>most</strong>
          or <strong>least.</strong> Again, the positive degree require no change in form. <br>
        </p>
        <h6 class="text-center">DEGREES OF COMPARISION BY ADVERB</h6>
        <p>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - This is <strong>bizarre.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - This is more <strong>bizarre</strong>. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - This is most <strong>bizarre</strong>. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - That is <strong>dangerous.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> -That is more <strong>dangerous</strong> than this. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - That is most <strong>dangerous</strong>. <br><br>

          <strong>POSITIVE</strong> - I feel <strong>tranquil.</strong> <br>
          <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong> - I feel more <strong>tranquil</strong>. <br>
          <strong>SUPARLATIVE</strong> - I feel most <strong>tranquil</strong>. <br><br>

          There is no set rule to follow that will let you know whether your adjective needs an adverb or a suffix to create the form of comparision. Some one-syllable words need an adverb. Some multi-syllable words may take a suffix.
          Your ear is the best judge. Use the version that sounds correct. <br><br>
          Please avoid redundancy in your forms of comparision. Never use a suffix and an adverb with a single adjective. One car is never more cheaper than another. It is simply cheaper. One joke is not the most funniest
          joke ever. It is simply the funniest. One modification of the adjective will suffice.

        </p><br>
        <h6>FORMING THE COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> A high-ranking goverment official spouted, "We need more bolder approaches." A member of the press corps called to ask if the adverb <strong>more</strong>
          was necessary. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>In order to dermine whether <strong>more</strong> was used correctly, it pears between <strong>more</strong> and <strong>bolder</strong>, then each describes the noun <strong>approaches.</strong>
          "We need more, bolder approaches." The politician is asking for approaches that are bolder and greater in frequency. His statement is correct. <br> Without a comma, <strong>more</strong>
          is redundant. The adjective <strong>bolder</strong> alone expresses the comparative degree of <strong>bold</strong>. It is sufficient unto itself and does not require
          the adverb <strong>more</strong>. Under this interpretation, the politician should have said, "We need bolder approaches."
        </p>
        <h6>MUCH MORE SIMPLE VS. SIMPLER</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>A member of the Presidential cabinet spoke a few weeks ago about taking some of the frills out of goverment. He stated, "Let's make this much more simple." <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>In the sentence, <strong>much more simple</strong> describes the pronoun <strong>this.</strong> <strong>Much</strong> is an adverb describing <strong>more</strong>. This cabinet member choose to use the adverb <strong>more</strong>
          to create the comparative form of the adjective <strong>simple</strong>. Couldn't have used <strong>simpler</strong> instead? The sentence would have read, "Let's make this much simpler."
          Either construction is grammatically correct, but the second is more concise and easier to comprehend.
        </p> <br>
        <h6>STRICT, STRICTER, STRICTEST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>Often, a fine line separates the meaning of one word from another. A defense attorney called to ask for an interpretation of a sentence from a document that was crucial to her argument. The sentence read, "The information will be kept in stricter confidence."
          She asked, "What difference does the form of strict make to the sentence?" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          All adjectives have three forms of comparison: the positive
          (<strong>strict</strong>), the comparative (<strong>stricter</strong>), and the superlative
          (<strong>strictest</strong>). The use of the comparative form, stricter, creates a weak
          construction. It tells us nothing about how strict the confidence is
          because we have nothing to compare it to. Is the confidence stricter
          than that kept by a man who shares information freely with anyone
          he meets on the street? If so, it may not be strict at all. Or is it
          stricter than the confidence kept by a tight-lipped Pentagon general? If so, it may be quite strict. <br>
          The author's intent probably was to indicate that the informa
          tion would be put under the tightest security. He should have used
          either the positive or the superlative form. The sentence could read,
          The Information will be kept in the strictest confidence" or "The
          information will be kept in strict confidence." Both imply tight-lipped secrecy.
        </p>
        <h6>IRREGULAR COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          Other adjectives have forms of comparison that defy attempt at formalization. These forms are irregularly compared. Their changes are case-specific, and you must memorize
          each in turn. Here is a partial list: <br><br>
          <p class="text-center"><strong>DEGREES OF IRREGULAR COMPARISION</strong></p>

        <h6>IRREGULAR DISTINCTIONS</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "What is the difference between the adjective <strong>farther</strong> and <strong>further</strong>" asked a sixth-grade teacher from Pennsylvania. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> Some readers may have noticed that a few of the irregularity compared adjectives have different forms in the comparative and suparlative degrees. One of these is the adjective <strong>far</strong>.
          The adjective in the <strong>far -> farther ->farthest</strong> progression refers to physical distance. <br>
          We reached the <strong>farther</strong> shore. <br><br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>far -> furher -> furthest</strong> progression refer to a mental or physical distance. <br>
          We drove the <strong>furthest</strong> distance that we could in a day. (physical distance) <br>
          That is the <strong>furthest</strong> thing from my mind. (mental distance) <br><br>
          Other adjectives carry similar distinctions in their forms of comparision. The adjectives in the <strong>old -> older -> oldest</strong> progression refer to age. <br>
          I am <strong>older</strong> than my sister. <br><br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>old -> elder -> eldest</strong> progression also refers to age but with the implication of advanced age. <br>
          My <strong>eldest</strong> brother is in his eighties. <br><br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>late -> later -> latest</strong> progression refer to order in time. <br>
          The time is <strong>later</strong> than I thought. <br> <br>
          The adjectives in the <strong>late -> latter -> last</strong> progression refer to a physical order in space. <br>
          Tom took the <strong>last</strong> fight home.
        </p><br>
        <h6>BETTER THAN BEST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>In a recent selection, one party ran an advertisement that began with the line "The Incumbent VS. The Challenger: Who is best?" Several callers asked if <strong>best</strong> was correct form of comparision to use. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>Since there are only two people contrasted here, the incumbent and the challenger, the spin doctors should have used
          the comparative form, <strong>better</strong>. "The Incumbent vs. The Challenger
          Who is Better?" Superlative forms, such as best, are reserved for
          situations that compare three or more objects. <br>
        </p>
        <h6>BAD, WORSE, WORST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong>  A sports enthusiast called to question a statement made by a
          star athlete. He said, "One of my favorite baseball players
          said, 'We're badder than them.' I know that badder is not correct
          but what could he have said instead?" <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>Caller was correct. The statement needed work. The
          forms of comparison for the adjective <strong>bad</strong> are <strong>bad -> worse ->
          worst</strong>. There is no word badder. Taking, proper form and intended meaning into account, he should have said, "We are <i>better</i> than
          they are."
          The National Grammar Hot Line recognizes that <strong>bad, badder,
          and baddest</strong> are slang for "terrific or wonderful," the exact opposite of the literal definitions of the words. The athlete was not
          trying to say that his team was worse than the opposition. Most
          slang is faddish, and some may becocets of the lexicon, but avoid it until it is.

        <h6>ADJECTIVES BEYOND COMPARISION</h6>
        <p>
          A number of adjectives are beyond comparison. The qualities
          that these adjectives express exist in only one degree. To compare
          objects according to one of these qualities creates a moot point
          since all objects with the quality possess it to an equal degree. Here
          is a partial list of uncomparable adjectives:

        How can one line be more perpendicular than another or the most
        perpendicular of all lines? There is but one degree of perpendicularity, and, to this degree, all things perpendicular are equal. In the
        same way, one accident cannot be more fatal than another. Their
        consequences are identical. They have both caused death. These
        adjectives and others like them are beyond comparison. <br>
        Please note that this uncomparability applies to these adjectives
        under their strictest definitions. English is a flexible language to say
        the least, and many people, expressing themselves in a creative
        way, have uttered one of these adjectives in the comparative or superlative degree. A grief-stricken man might say, "I have never felt
        more alone than I do now." A flea market shopper, using the adjective unique to mean "unusual or distinct," could say, "This is the
        most unique lamp I have ever seen." These sentences contain uncomparable adjectives in comparative and superlative forms.
        Often, the speaker's intention is to indicate that one object more closely approximates the perfect state described by the adjective
        than another. We normal speakers are allowed this same poetic license, but take care that each usage is a sensible one.

       <h6>LESS OR FEWER</h6>
       <p>
         <strong>Q. </strong>"How can I keep less and fewer straight? I always confuse
          them, and I don't understand the difference," stated an irritable copywriter. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong>
          Both words are adjectives. <strong>Less</strong> modifies nouns that name a
          whole or a collection but are singular in number. <strong>Fewer</strong> modifies nouns that name a number of separate objects and are plural.
          For instance, one would have <strong>less</strong> knowledge but <strong>fewer</strong> facts, <strong>less</strong>
          time but <strong>fewer</strong> minutes, <strong>less</strong> heat but <strong>fewer</strong> fires, <strong>less</strong> congestion
          but <strong>fewer</strong> cars, <strong>less</strong> traffic but <strong>fewer</strong> accidents, and <strong>less</strong> inclement
          weather but <strong>fewer</strong> storms.

        <h3>POSITIONING THE ADJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>
          The conscientious grammarian needs to know where to place
          his or her adjectives. An adjective can either precede or follow the
          noun that it modifies, depending upon a number of factors which
          we will now consider.
        </p><br>
        <h5>TYPICAL USAGE</h5>
        <p>
          Adjectives typically precede the nouns that they modify. <br><br>
          My <strong>tired</strong> feet need a massage. <br>
          The birds' calls blended into a <strong>sweet</strong> song. <br>
          I appeal to your keen intellect. <br><br>
          In the first example, the adjective <strong>tired</strong> precedes the noun modified, <strong>feet</strong>. In the second example, the adjective <strong>sweet</strong> precedes the
          noun modified, <strong>song</strong>, In the third example, the adjective <strong>keen</strong> precedes the noun modified, <strong>intellect</strong>.
        </p><br>
        <h5>SPECIAL USAGE</h5>
        <p>
          Some adjectives are placed after the nouns they modify for no
          discernible reason. This is merely the way it is done. For instance
          we speak of a notary public, a court martial, and an attorney general.
          The adjective <strong>public</strong> describes the noun <strong>notary</strong>, the adjective
          <strong>martial</strong> describes the noun </strong>court, and the adjective <strong>general</strong> describes
          the noun <strong>attorney</strong>. Typical adjective usage suggests that we
          "public notary" or "martial court" or "general attorney," but
          actual usage dictates otherwise. These instances you must learn on
          a case-by-case basis.
        </p><br>
        <h5>EMPHATIC USAGE</h5>
        <p>
          Place the adjective after the noun modified to emphasize the
          qualities described by the adjective. <br><br>
          A man, <strong>old</strong> and <strong>wise</strong>, gave me these instructions. <br>
          Can you hear the emphasis that the alternative placement puts on
          the adjectives <strong>old</strong> and <strong>wise</strong>? Their position highlights the man's
          age and wisdom. The sentence could just as well read, "An old,
          wise man gave me these instructions." But such a construction removes the emphasis from the adjectives.
        </p>
        <h5>USAGE AS OBJECT COMPLEMENTS</h5>
        <p>
          Adjectives that serve as object complements follow the direct
          objects that they modify. <br><br>
          Have you heard anything <strong>new</strong>? <br>
          I asked you to bring something <strong>blue</strong>. <br>
          We found her <strong>tiresome</strong>. <br>
          That made me <strong>hungry</strong>. <br><br>
          In the first example, the adjective <strong>new</strong> is the object complement
          of the direct object <strong>anything</strong>. In the second example, the adjective
          <strong>blue</strong> is the object complement of the direct object <strong>something</strong>. In the
          third example, the adjective<strong> tiresome</strong> is the object complement of
          the direct object <strong>her</strong>. In the fourth example, the adjective <strong>hungry</strong> is
          the object complement of the direct object <strong>me</strong>.
        </p>
        USAGE AS SUBJECT COMPLEMENTS
        Adjectives used as subject complements must follw linking
        so, sy necessity, follow the nouns and pronouns that
        verbs and
        they m
