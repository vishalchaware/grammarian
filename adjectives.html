      <h1 class="my-4 text-center">ADJECTIVES</h1>

      <div class="border p-4 my-3 h3 font-weight-normal Ubuntu text-center">
        <p>
          <strong>Adjectives</strong> are words that modify nouns or pronouns .
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <p>
          One task of language is to paint a picture. If verbs and nouns are outlines and shapes, then adjectives are colors and textures. Adjectives fall into a broad class of words called <strong>modifiers</strong>.
          A modifiers is any word that acts to describe or qualify another words in such a way that it changes the other word's meaning. Describing and qualifying nouns and pronouns are the primary function of adjectives.
          <br><br>Here is a simple example: "I watched a movie on television." This sentence is not terribly informative or inspirational because it lacks adjectives. To accurately describe
          the wonders of modern technology, we need to add some color: "I watched the <strong>greatest action </strong> movie of all time, <i>Star Wars,</i> on my <strong>new, delightally-enhanced</strong>
          television." The addition of the adjectives changes what we know of the nouns.

        <h3>TYPES OF ADJECTIVES</h3>
        <p>
          There are two main flavors of adjective: <strong>descriptive</strong> and <strong>limiting.</strong>
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase">Descriptive adjectives </h5>
        <p>
          Descriptive adjectives describe the nouns and pronouns they modify. They point out color, shape, texture, scent or any other quality that entities named by nouns and pronouns can
          possess.This is the function of the adjective with which we are the most familiar. <br><br>
          The <strong>hot</strong> pan burnt my fingers. <br>
          I'll have a <strong>tall</strong> glass of lemonade. <br>
          I am <strong>thirsty.</strong> <br><br>

          In the first example, the adjective <strong>hot</strong> describes the noun <strong>pan.</strong> In the second example, the adjective <strong>tall</strong> describes the noun <strong>glass</strong>.
          In the third example, the adjective <strong>thirsty</strong> describes the pronouns<strong> I.</strong> <br><br>
          Some of the descriptive adjectives are also <strong>proper adjectives,</strong> derived from proper nouns. Usually, the proper noun undergoes some mild changes in form on its way to becoming an adjective.
          The proper noun <strong>America</strong> changes into proper adjective <strong>American.</strong> The proper noun <strong>Orwell</strong> turns into the proper adjective <strong>Orwellian.</strong>
          <br><br><strong>America</strong> had no idea what one day would be <strong>American.</strong> <br>
          <strong>Orwell</strong> imagined a bleak, <strong>Orwellian</strong> future. <br><br>
          Proper adjectives need to be capitalized as are the proper nounsin which they have origins.
        </p> <br>
        <h6>CHOOSING THE CORRECT ADJECTIVE</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "My boyfriend said to me, 'That is heaven.' Shouldn't he have said 'That is heavenly'?" asked a young woman. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> The young lady was, indeed,correct. <strong>Heaven</strong> is a noun. It names the place in which her boyfriend found himself. <strong>Heavenly</strong>
          is an adjective. It describes the feelings her boyfriend had. He should have said, "That is heavenly."
        </p><br>
        <h6>THE NATURE OF MANIFEST</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Q. </strong> "Is <strong>manifest</strong> a verb or an adjective?" Inquired a historian who frequented the Hot Line. <br><br>
          <strong>Ans. </strong> <strong>Manifest</strong> can be a verb or an adjectives. As an adjective, it means "evident or obvious." <br>
          His destiny is <strong>manifest.</strong> <br>
          We discussed the <strong>manifest</strong> content of my dream. <br><br>
          As a verb, it means "to become obvious." <br>
          Her happiness <strong>manifested</strong> itself in her smile. <br>
          His curiosity <strong>manifests</strong> itself in his question. <br><br>
          Be aware that there is another adjective, <strong>manifestable,</strong> derived from the verb. <br>
          His guilt was <strong>manifestable</strong> because of the strong evidence. <br>
          Your unconscious desires are <strong>manifestable</strong> under the therapist's tutelage.
          <br>Manifestable means "able to become obvious."
        </p> <br>
        <h5>LIMITING ADJECTIVE</h5>
        <p>
          Limiting adjectives restrict the definitions of the nouns and pronouns they modify. The demonstrative pronouns sometimes function as limiting adjectives because they point
          out certain objects from a group. <br> <strong>This</strong> dog is mine. <br><br>
          Which dog is mine? This dog is mine. Not that dog or that dog. That other dog over there isn't either. This dog here in front of me is mine. The demonstrative pronoun <strong>this</strong>
          limits the meaning of the noun <strong>dog</strong> by identifying it with a single animal. <br><br>
          Most standard limiting adjectives describe quantity. These include the numbers, <strong>one, two, three,</strong> etc., and assorted quantity such as <strong>half, double, daily,</strong> and <strong>weekly</strong>, among others. <br>
          I found <strong>five</strong> dollar in my pocket. <br>
          I read the <strong>daily</strong> paper. <br><br>
          The adjective in the first example answers the question "How many dollars did I find?" The answer is "five dollars." The adjective <strong>five</strong> limits the meaning of the noun <strong>dollars</strong>
          by telling how many were found. Because of its influence, we know the five, and not one, ten, or twenty dollars, was found. <br>
          The adjective in the second example answers the question "What kind of paper do I read?" The answer is "a daily paper." The adjective daily limits the meaning of the noun <strong>paper.</strong>
          It tells us that the paper is the daily kind, not the biweekly, monthly, or yearly kind.
        </p>
        <h6>FROM MY FILES: POLITICALLY CORRECT GRAMMAR</h6>
        <p>
          I recently heard the mayor of a major American city speak about the battle raging between grammatical and political correctness. What are the difference between words or phrases that are politically correctlyand their
          and their grammatically correct counterparts? There need not be any difference at all. Speech can be both grammatically correct and socially aware. What identifications do you
          make with each of these pairs of labels: a blind Indian vs. a visually impaired Native American, a barmaid vs. a bardender, a third-world country vs. a developing nation, ignorant vs. educationally disadvantagedd, a salesman vs. a salesperson, a
          chairman vs. a chair? The first in each pair is outdated and politically incorrect, whereas the second is sensitive,  modern, <i>and</i> grammatically correct. <br><br>
          While it is important that our words show respect, we must not let our desires not to offend carry our speech to a ridiculous extreme. Author Sue Grafton twits political correctness
          in her book. <i>L is for Lawless</i> by deliberately forming some strange constructions. She names a girl stewardperson instead of a stewardess, places a bellhuman in place
          of a bellboy, and asked that desks be "personed" insted of "manned." Whichever words you choose, be aware that they can elicit a smile or a frown.
